This is admin3, a registrar from XXX University. The university has sent me the new semester's course schedule via email with the subject "Course Schedule Notification." I need you to help me find the courses I'm responsible for from the attached master schedule and create corresponding courses on Canvas for the instructors. The specific requirements are as follows:

- The course name on Canvas should be formatted as **Course Subject - Class Time**, for example, "Art Appreciation - Wednesday 1, 2, 3."
- Assign the corresponding instructor as the teacher for each course on Canvas. The instructors' emails are saved in my local workspace.
- Publish an announcement for each course that includes the instructor's name and the class time.
- If an instructor is teaching the same course multiple times, these courses should be set up for resource sharing in Canvas.
- The syllabi for each course are saved in my workspace. Please publish them for their respective courses.
- All courses I am responsible for need to be published.
