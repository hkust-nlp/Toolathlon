We are about to prepare a detailed market data sheet for the quantitative research team's monthly report. Please create a Google Sheet named '2025_Q2_Market_Data' and within it, a worksheet named 'May-Jun_2025' (if it already exists, just write to it). Automatically retrieve daily data for 'AAPL', 'TSLA', 'NVDA', and 'META' for June and July 2025, including Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume. Write this data in the 'May-Jun_2025' worksheet in the order of Ticker | Date | Open | High | Low | Close | Adj Close | Volume | Data Check. If data is missing for a particular day, please highlight the corresponding cell and mark 'Missing' in the 'Data Check' column. Once all data has been retrieved and validated, publish the read-only Google Sheet link in the format 'Google Sheet : {url}' to the 'Quant Research' sub-page under the 'MCPTestPage' workspace in Notion. Also, add a comment at the top of the sub-page that says: 'Monthly market data is ready; missing items have been marked. The reporting team can view it directly.
