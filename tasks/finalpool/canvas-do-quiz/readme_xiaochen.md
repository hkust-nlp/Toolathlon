The main challenge of this task is that there are too many courses. If the model does not finish all the quizzes for every course, it will incorrectly consider the task complete and exit.  
To ensure the correctness of quiz answers, both Claude 4 and Gemini models are used for verification. During test runs, any incorrect answers given by the models are reviewed.  
For example:  
QUIZ 2: PHIL201 Advanced Logical Reasoning and Argumentation Quiz**  
Question 1: The answer was checked manually and found to be correct.
