I'm an accountant in the R&D department of a tech company, and I need your help to organize our department's commuting expense reimbursement forms. The reimbursement data comes from taxi bill PDFs located in the 'bills/' folder for the last three months. Please go through all the PDFs and extract the 'billing period' (e.g., 'June 2024') and 'total amount' from each bill. Then, create an Excel file named 'department_expenses.xlsx'. The Excel file for the reimbursement forms must strictly follow the 'Bill_Format.xlsx' located in the workspace, and the data processing requirements should refer to 'requirement.txt'.
