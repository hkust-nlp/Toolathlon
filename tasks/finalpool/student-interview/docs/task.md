I am a professor, recently some students have sent me resumes, I need to finish their interviews today. Due to the number of people being too many, I will only communicate with students who have independent first-author publications. Please, in the email inbox, help me screen the resumes, and check the calendar's free time. I want to finish the interviews within the two days of today and tomorrow, it cannot conflict with other work in the schedule, at the same time each student must be reserved at least one and a half hours of time for the interview, it must be scheduled during working hours: 8 AM to 5 PM. Finally, sync the relevant schedule into Google Calendar, and tell me what time slots they have been scheduled for respectively?
