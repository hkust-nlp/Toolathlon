I am a professor, recently some students have sent me resumes by eamils, and I will only communicate with students who have independent first-author publications. I want to finish the interviews within the two days of tomorrow and the day after tomorrow (Hong Kong Time), at the same time each student must be reserved at least one and a half hours of time for the interview, it must be scheduled during working hours: 8 AM to 5 PM. Finally, sync the relevant schedule into Google Calendar, and tell me what time slots they have been scheduled for respectively?
