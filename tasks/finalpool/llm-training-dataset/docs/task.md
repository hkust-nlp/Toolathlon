I've been learning about large-scale language models recently, and I've decided to train a decoder-only language model on my own. The first step is to prepare pre-training data, so I need your help organizing the pre-training data for llama and gpt-neo into the `ptdata` sheet in `LLM Pre-training Data` spreadsheet. The pre-training data should be sorted in descending order by data size, with columns named `name`, `use in llm` (the value should only include llama and gpt-neo; if used by both models, it should be either gpt-neo or llama), `size` (the numeric value in GB, but do not include "GB" in cell), and `link` in order. The link to huggingface is preferred; if huggingface doesn't have the dataset, we'll try to provide other links.
