I am a WooCommerce store owner, and my shop has warehouses in the following cities: New York, Boston, Dallas, LA, San Francisco, Houston. Please help me: Check each warehouse SQLite database (located in the warehouse directory in the workspace) for the latest product inventory list (identified by Product ID) that has been uploaded but not yet updated in the online WooCommerce store. Use the WooCommerce MCP server to synchronize the inventory updates to the WooCommerce online store according to the city-to-region mapping.
