Analyze the wandb project https://wandb.ai/mluo/deepscaler-1.5b?nw=nwusermluo, identify the experiment with the best validation set performance, and find which step performed best in that experiment. Save the best_experiment_name, best_step, and best_val_score to a CSV file named `best_experiment.csv` in the workspace.
