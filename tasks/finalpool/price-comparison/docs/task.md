As a member of the market analysis team, you are urgently tasked with analyzing the price differences between our core product line and our primary competitor, FutureGadget. We have scraped pricing information from our competitor's website (stored in PDF format), and we have also obtained our corresponding product prices from the internal file, internal_pricing_sheet.xlsx. Finally, please combine and process these two sets of data, calculate the price difference, and store the final comparison results (including product name, our price, competitor's price, and price difference) in BigQuery for management decision-making. Please refer to the workspace file requirements.md for storage format requirements.
