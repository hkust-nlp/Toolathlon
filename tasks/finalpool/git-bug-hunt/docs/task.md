In the `LUFFY` Git repository within the workspace, we've identified a serious performance issue introduced by a commit containing the variable 'remove_caching_layer'. You need to find the earliest commit that introduced this variable, get the author's name and email for that commit, and write an email to the author. The subject of the email should be '[URGENT] Performance Issue Investigation Regarding Your Commit'. The body of the email should include the commit hash and the full commit message of the discovered commit, formatted according to the `template.txt` file in the workspace.
