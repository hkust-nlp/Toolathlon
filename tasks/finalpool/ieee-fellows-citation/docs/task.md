My name is Junxian He, and I'm a faculty member at HKUST. I'm looking for collaborators and need to collect personal information of scholars who have cited my articles, specifically those with a citation count greater than 3,000. Please help me gather as much information as possible for scholars meeting this requirement. For the format of the high-citation scholar information, please refer to the `return_format.json` file. If no scholars with over 1,000 citations are found, please refer to the `without_citation.json` file for the return format. Finally, please save the JSON results to a file named `high_citation_scholars_results.json`.
