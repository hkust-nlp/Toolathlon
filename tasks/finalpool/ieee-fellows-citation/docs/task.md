Please help me to search for the personal information of scholars who have cited paper of Professor He Junxian from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and have more than 3,000 citations. Additionally, please collect the information of at least five scholars who meet these requirements. For the format of the high-citation scholar information, please refer to the `return_format.json` file. If no scholars with over 3,000 citations are found, please refer to the `without_citation.json` file for the return format. Finally, please save the JSON results to a file named `high_citation_scholars_results.json`.
