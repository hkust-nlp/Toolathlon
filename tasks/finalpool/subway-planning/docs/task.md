I am staying at the Hilton Garden Inn Singapore and would like to travel to Changi Airport MRT station. I prefer not to use any mode of transport other than the MRT. Please design a route with the shortest walking distance. Finally, please save all the stations passed in sequential order to a file named `routine.txt`, with one station per line.
