I am staying at the Singapore Mobility Gallery and would like to travel to Changi Airport MRT station. I prefer not to use any mode of transport other than the MRT. Please design a route with the shortest walking distance. Finally, please save all the stations (including the ones passed along the way) in sequential order to a file named routine.txt, with one station per line.
