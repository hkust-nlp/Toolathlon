A production line in the factory streams real-time data through IoT sensors into the live_sensor table of the machine_operating dataset in BigQuery. The normal operating parameter ranges (minimum/maximum values) for each machineâ€™s sensors are defined in a configuration file named machine_operating_parameters.xlsx. Please query the live_sensor table in the machine_operating dataset in BigQuery for sensor data between 11:30 and 12:30 on August 19, 2025, and, using the parameter ranges from the Excel file, identify all readings that fall outside their normal ranges (you may choose any efficient method for comparison). Compile the final anomaly report with the fields timestamp, machine_id, sensor_type, reading, normal_range into a file named anomaly_report.csv, save it to the workspace, and upload it to the cloud storage bucket named iot_anomaly_reports (create it if not exists).
