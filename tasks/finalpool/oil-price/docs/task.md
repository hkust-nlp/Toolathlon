I have prepared two data tables in the Notion `Oil Price` page. Please fetch WTI and Brent monthly prices for the last 12 months from Yahoo Finance, analyze the WTI-Brent oil spread changes and calculate related indicators, implement a z-score-based spread trading strategy backtest, and return a summary report.

For detailed technical specifications, please refer to the `detail.md` file.
