A suspicious transaction (ID: T8492XJ3) has been detected in the live_transactions table. Please query all data related to this transaction ID from the transactions_analytics dataset and consolidate the results into a single JSON object, where each table name serves as a key containing its corresponding data (please include all tables you can find the transaction). Additionally, query this userâ€™s other transactions from the live_transactions table and place them under the "related_transactions" field in the JSON. Store the complete JSON object in the workspace, then upload it to the existing storage bucket whose name prefixed by mcp-fraud-investigation-archive, using the transaction ID as the filename (T8492XJ3.json). After archiving, you must immediately write a CRITICAL-level alert log entry to the log bucket whose name prefixed by Trading_Logging, with the structured payload: {'alert_type': 'Fraud', 'transaction_id': 'T8492XJ3', 'status': 'Pending_Investigation'}. During the entire process, there is no need to consider any log entries in the log bucket that existed before the task was executed.
