I want to depart from the Nihonbashi Exit of Tokyo Station, with the goal of reaching Kamakura Station. I prefer a direct route. I'd like to buy a Starbucks before departure. For convenience, this Starbucks should be as close as possible to the Nihonbashi Entrance of Tokyo Station. After arriving at the Kamakura Station, I want to reach the Kamakura Museum of History and Culture in the shortest possible distance. Please return a complete planned route for me. You need to follow the format in `format.json` and save it as `travel_plan.json`.
