Please read the table titled "GDP2022" in Google Sheets and calculate the CR5 index for each of the seven major regions listed by the World Bank. Create a new spreadsheet in Google Sheets, name it "GDP CR5 Analysis", and within it, create a new table titled "gdp_cr5_analysis". Save the following data: `Region`, `Top5_Countries`, `Top5_GDP_Sum`, `Region_GDP_Total`, and `CR5_Ratio`, where they represent the region name, the top five countries (separated by commas), the sum of the top five countries' GDP, the total regional GDP, and the CR5 index (percentage, rounded to two decimal places). Sort the data in descending order by CR5 index. (If you're unsure which region the World Bank assigns a country to, you can search for it yourself.)
