Several new students who have changed majors will be taking courses this semester. A new summary sheet for the course `Introduction to AI-8` has been created in the workspace, and it shows that some of the students have not yet been enrolled in it. You need to enroll these students. Since they missed the first assignment, privately message only these newly enrolled students to inform them that their first assignment grade will be the same as their second, and remind them to complete the assignment diligently.
