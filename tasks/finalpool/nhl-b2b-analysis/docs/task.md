Conduct a detailed analysis of the NHL 2024–2025 schedule (in spreadsheet `NHL 2425 Schedule`) and calculate how many back-to-back sets each team will face this season. Please also break down, for each team, the number of occurrences in each of the four home/away configurations: Home–Away (HA), Away–Home (AH), Home–Home (HH), and Away–Away (AA). Organize the results into a newspreadsheet named `NHL-B2B-Analysis`. The table headers should exactly be: `Team,HA,AH,HH,AA,Total`.
