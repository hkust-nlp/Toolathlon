Your task is to check your email for homework2 submissions and grade on Canvas. Please download Python files from email attachments to local workspace and execute each Python file in terminal to check for errors. If the Python file is correct, give it a score of 10 in Canvas; otherwise, give it a score of 0. You could check the requirements of homework2 in `assignments/homework2.md`and students' ID in `student_canvas_ids.csv`. For students who submitted multiple times, use the latest submission.
