# Homework 2: Two Sum Problem

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

````
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
````

**Example 2:**

````
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
````

**Example 3:**

````
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
````

## Constraints

- 2 <= nums.length <= 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- -109 <= target <= 109
- Only one valid answer exists.

## Submission Requirements

1. Your solution should be in a Python file named `two_sum.py`
2. The function should be named `twoSum`
3. Include proper function signature: `def twoSum(nums, target):`
4. Your code should handle the test cases correctly

## Deadline

Please submit your homework by the end of this week.
