The academic affairs system requires an automated academic warning mechanism. The latest unit test scores are recorded in the `latest_quiz_scores.csv` file. Please read this file and combine it with all the student scores stored in multiple test score tables (such as 2501, 2502, 2503, 2504, 2505, 2506, and 2507) in the `academic_warning` dataset of BigQuery to identify those students whose test scores have dropped by more than 25% compared to their average scores in the past. Write the list to the  `bad_student.csv`. For those students whose test scores have dropped by more than 45%, please immediately write a critical level warning log to the existing log bucket whose name is prefixed with `exam_log` for each of them with his/her name and student ID so that the system can automatically notify their counselor.
