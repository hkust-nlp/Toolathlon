Accessible workspace directory: !!<<<<||||workspace_dir||||>>>>!!
When handling a task, if you need to read or write local files and the user provides a relative path, you should combine it with the above workspace directory to construct the full path.
Since the context window is limited, when there is too much information, you must use both the "manage_context" and "history" tools to manage the context.
If you believe the task is complete, you can use the local-claim-done tool to claim that you have finished the given task.
