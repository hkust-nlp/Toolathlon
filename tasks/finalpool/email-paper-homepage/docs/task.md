Update my personal homepage according to the following rules:
- This should be a remote task that involves modifying the actual repository for my personal homepage. Whenever you perform an action related to a repository, you must check **all repositories**, including forked repos.
- For papers currently marked as "preprint" or "under review" on my homepage, update their acceptance information according to my emails.
- Update the status of code open-sourcing. If there is a released repository on my GitHub for the corresponding paper, update it on my homepage.
