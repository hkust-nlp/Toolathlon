The model should be able to find the pages of the two datasets. In the Raw section, we wrote that the data was constructed from the original dataset by the HuggingfaceTB Team. The model should be able to locate the original PythonEdu dataset from here and obtain its license. In the Reasoning section, we stated that the data was synthesized with DeepSeek-V2.5, so the model should also be able to find the license for this model. The rest is relatively straightforward.
