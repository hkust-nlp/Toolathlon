Our coaching staff is currently working on season-long conditioning and rotation planning, with particular concern about “back-to-back games” (cases where the same team plays on two consecutive days, with exactly 1 day apart between game dates). Hockey is extremely demanding, and if a season contains many back-to-back sets—especially when the second game is often on the road—it can seriously impact player recovery and team performance.

Therefore, I’d like you to conduct a detailed analysis of the NHL 2024–2025 schedule (NHL 2024–2025 Schedule Data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18Gpg5cauraSBIfrpn2VWbC7B2M999XpyPTVy3E29Pv8/edit?gid=1113684723#gid=1113684723) and calculate how many back-to-back sets each team will face this season. Please also break down, for each team, the number of occurrences in each of the four home/away configurations: Home–Away (HA), Away–Home (AH), Home–Home (HH), and Away–Away (AA). Note: Directly reading all content from the Google Sheet would be very lengthy.

Organize the results into a table named "nhl_b2b_analysis", which must be set to publicly accessible in Google Sheets, and also save a local copy in the workspace as `nhl_b2b_analysis.csv`. The table headers should contain: `Team,HA,AH,HH,AA,Total`, also save the google sheet URL as {"google_sheet_url": } in the workspace's `google_sheet_url.json`.

where Total represents the total number of back-to-back sets faced by each team across the season (i.e., the sum of HA, AH, HH, and AA).

This will make it easier for our coaches and data analysts to review and discuss later.
