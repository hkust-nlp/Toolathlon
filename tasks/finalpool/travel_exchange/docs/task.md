I (Andrew) and another friend (Lau) traveled to Turkey during 2025. Please help me read the files in the personal workspace, find our bills and additional memory notes, query the exchange rates for the corresponding dates, convert each day's expenses to Chinese Yuan (CNY), and calculate the total trip cost for both of us in CNY. 

Make sure to check both our CSV expense records AND our memory files (memory_Andrew.md and memory_Lau.md) where we recorded additional expenses we remembered later. All expenses from both sources should be included in the final calculation.

Output the result in {"total": xx} format to the specified file "total_cost.json" in the workspace.
