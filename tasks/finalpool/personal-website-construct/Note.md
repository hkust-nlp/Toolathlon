For this task, I first provided the LLM with the information from my personal homepage (https://vicent0205.github.io/) so it could extract and store my details in memory. At the same time, I gave it a personal website template, and asked it to fill in my information.

However, it seems that Claude 4 tries to call some non-existent tools, which causes issues during the process.
assistant:  Now I need to copy the essential template files and directories. Let me copy the necessary files from the original template:

Error during interaction: Tool filesystem-push_files not found in agent Assistant
Error when running agent - Tool filesystem-push_files not found in agent Assistant

You need to help me build a personalized academic website based on an existing template repository and personal information stored in memory. I will provide you with:

1) An example personal website repository as a template, in folder academicpages.github.io
2) Personal information and details stored in memory about an individual

Your task is to:
1) Analyze the provided example website repository structure and content
2) Extract relevant personal information from the stored memory 
3) Customize and modify the template website by integrating the personal information from memory
4) Create a new repository with the customized website
5) Push the new repository to GitHub with the name "example_website"

Ensure that all personal information from memory is accurately integrated into the website, including personal details, academic background, research experience, publications, skills, and contact information. Do not add or modify any information beyond what is provided in the memory and do not add other pages like CV pages.
