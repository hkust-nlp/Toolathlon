这个任务我先 把我主页（https://vicent0205.github.io/）的信息给llm，给我转出了memory，同时给了个人主页的网站模版，我让他把我的信息补充上去

但是claude4 好像会调用一些不存在的tool导致出问题。。。
assistant:  Now I need to copy the essential template files and directories. Let me copy the necessary files from the original template:

Error during interaction: Tool filesystem-push_files not found in agent Assistant
Error when running agent - Tool filesystem-push_files not found in agent Assistant

You need to help me build a personalized academic website based on an existing template repository and personal information stored in memory. I will provide you with:

1) An example personal website repository as a template, in folder academicpages.github.io
2) Personal information and details stored in memory about an individual

Your task is to:
1) Analyze the provided example website repository structure and content
2) Extract relevant personal information from the stored memory 
3) Customize and modify the template website by integrating the personal information from memory
4) Create a new repository with the customized website
5) Push the new repository to GitHub with the name "example_website"

Ensure that all personal information from memory is accurately integrated into the website, including personal details, academic background, research experience, publications, skills, and contact information. Do not add or modify any information beyond what is provided in the memory and do not add other pages like CV pages.
