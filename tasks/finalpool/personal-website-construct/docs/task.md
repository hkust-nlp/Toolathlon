Help me build a personalized academic website based on the personal information stored in memory. Use the template repository https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io and create a new repository `LJT-Homepage`. This should be a remote task that involves creating an actual repository on github. Ensure that all personal information from memory is accurately integrated into the website, including personal details, academic background, research experience, publications, skills, and contact information. Do not add or modify any information beyond what is provided in the memory and do not add other pages.
