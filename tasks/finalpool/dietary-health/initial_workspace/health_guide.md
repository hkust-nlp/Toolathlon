# Experienced Dietary Ratios for Muscle Gain and Fat Loss

Unit: g = daily intake per kg of body weight (g/kg)

| Type          | Cycle         | Carbs (g/kg)  | Protein (g/kg) |
| :------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :------------- |
| **Muscle Gain** | Male          | 3.5-4.5       | 1.5-2          |
|               | Female        | 3-3.5         | 1.5            |
| **Fat Loss** | Male (Initial)| 2.5-3         | 1.5            |
|               | Male (Late)   | 2-2.5         | 1.2-1.5        |
|               | Female (Initial)| 2.5-3         | 1.5            |
|               | Female (Late) | 2-2.5         | 1.2-1.5        |

**Adjustment Methods (Carbs as Calorie Variable):**

1.  **For muscle gain, try for 2 weeks**. Adjust if weight increases by about 1%.
    Reduce carbs if gaining too fast, increase carbs if gaining too slow. Adjust carbs by about 0.5g.

2.  **For fat loss, try for 2 weeks**. Adjust if weight decreases by about 2%.
    Reduce carbs if losing too slow, increase carbs if losing too fast. Adjust carbs by about 0.5g.
    There's more room for rapid carb reduction from the initial to late stages of fat loss, but don't rush.

3.  **No need to recalculate ratios after small weight changes**, as it's only a few grams difference.
    No need to recalculate during the muscle gain phase. During the fat loss phase, you can recalculate once after losing 5-10 kg.

**Notes (For Large-Bodied Obese Individuals):**

* **For large-bodied obese individuals with BMI > 28**, reduce initial carb intake during the fat loss phase (Male 2.4-2.7g, Female 2.1-2.4g), reduce protein (Male 1.2g), and reduce fat (Male 0.6g).
* **For large-bodied obese individuals with BMI > 32**, reduce initial carb intake during the fat loss phase (Male 2.0-2.4g, Female 1.7-2.0g), reduce protein (Male 1.0g), and reduce fat (Male 0.5g).
* **The above table refers to training days**. On rest days, reduce carb intake (by 0.5g compared to training days).

**Note: Protein intake can fluctuate by +/- 10g from the allocated amount and still be within expectations. Carbohydrate intake must be strictly controlled within the given range.**
