I need to perform privacy data desensitization on my documents. The files may contain sensitive information that needs protection. Please help me scan documents in the specified directory, identify and desensitize privacy information. All sensitive information should be uniformly replaced with three asterisks `***`. Original files cannot be modified; only create desensitized copies and save them. Each file's desensitized copy should be named as `original_filename_desensitized.extension` and saved.

Main sensitive information types to process:
- Phone numbers (US format)
- Social Security Numbers (SSN)
- Email addresses  
- Credit card numbers
- IP addresses
