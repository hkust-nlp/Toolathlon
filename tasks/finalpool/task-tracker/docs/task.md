Please find all developers' branches in the `BenchTasksCollv2` project for the most recent commits that added new tasks. For each personâ€™s new tasks, check the development status (do not check the file content). If the structure is complete, it is considered implemented; otherwise, it is considered implementing. Update our Notion page: implementation based on the new tasks, and create a new branch in GitHub named finalpool, adding the implemented tasks to finalpool, with the relative path in the project being tasks/finalpool.
