Please find all developers' branches in the `BenchTasksCollv3` project for the most recent commits that added new tasks. For each personâ€™s new tasks, check the development status (do not check the file content). If the implementation satisfies the requirements, it is considered implemented; otherwise, it is considered implementing. Update our Notion page: `Task Tracker` based on the new tasks, and create a new branch in GitHub named finalpool, adding all of the implemented tasks in Notion Page to finalpool, with the relative path in the project being `tasks/finalpool`.

Tips:

- You could find the requirements in `tasks/examples`
- In addition to the content requirements explicitly mentioned in the examples, only the existence of the file needs to be checked
