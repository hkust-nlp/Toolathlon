Please check all customers who have completed their first order in our store in the past 7 days and immediately sync their information (name, email address, etc.) from WooCommerce to our core customer relationship database (BigQuery). At the same time, send a welcome email to each customer via Poste. Please follow the email format in the template (`welcome_email_template.md`). You can find my email configuration file under the workspace. Thanks!
