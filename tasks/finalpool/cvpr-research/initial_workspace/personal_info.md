# About Me

## Research Areas
**Main Research Area:** Visual Generative Models

**Specific Fields:** Application and innovation of diffusion models, flow matching and related technologies in tasks such as image generation, video generation, and cross-modal generation.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on advancing the frontier of visual content generation through deep generative models. I am particularly interested in:

- **Diffusion Models & Flow Matching**: Developing efficient sampling strategies and improving the quality-diversity trade-off in generative processes
- **Video Generation**: Exploring temporal consistency and motion dynamics in video synthesis using state-of-the-art generative frameworks
- **Cross-modal Generation**: Bridging different modalities (text-to-image, image-to-video, audio-visual synthesis) through unified generative architectures
- **Controllable Generation**: Investigating methods for fine-grained control over generated content while maintaining high fidelity
- **Efficient Inference**: Optimizing generative models for real-world deployment with reduced computational costs
