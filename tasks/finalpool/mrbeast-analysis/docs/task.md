I am a new video content creator, and I want to analyze the video style and patterns of the creator "MrBeast". I would like to know when videos generally perform better in terms of traffic, and what video length is most suitable. Please help me analyze MrBeast's video publishing patterns from early 2024 to before July 1, 2025. Identify the most common day of the week for video uploads, the average video length (excluding videos shorter than one minute), and the average number of days between uploads. Obtain the transcripts of the video to understand the content and roughly classify its genre into "'Charity', 'Invited_Challenge', 'Personal_Challenge', 'Showcase', 'Collaboration', 'Short'". Fill all the results into the existing sheets in result.xlsx in the workspace. Do not create new sheets without authorization. Please keep two decimal places for all decimal numbers.
