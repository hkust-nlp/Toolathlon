My personal information is all stored in memory. Based on the course information on Canvas, as well as my assignment and quiz submission status. Find all my unfinished course assignments and quizzes that need to be completed, organize the information according to the required fields in the workspace's CSV header, keeping the format consistent with the example, and complete this CSV file in ascending order by the quiz deadline (DDL). Noted that quizzes and assignments should be recorded separately in two different files following the examples in workspace.
