My name is Zachary Edwards, and I’m a forgetful person. I often complete my assignments but forget to submit them. All of my assignments are saved somewhere in my workspace, but I can’t remember their filenames. Please search for the matching files based on the assignment content. Do not create assignment content on your own. Only submit the assignments I have already written. If you can't find them, do not submit anything.

My personal information can be found in memory.

The instructor has published a submission record sheet named Cinema_Culture_Grade_Summary.xlsx. Please help me identify which assignments have not been submitted yet. Then, use the Playwright tool to submit the missing assignments via the server at localhost:10001.

You only need to submit the assignments that are missing — no need to take action on those that are already submitted.

Also, I want to mention that I was officially excused from Assignment 2 due to a leave of absence. I informed the instructor at the time the assignment was given. The formal leave document is saved somewhere in my workspace, but the TA seems to have forgotten about it.

After submitting the required assignments, please also:
Locate the leave document.
Send an email to the TA to remind them about my approved leave for Assignment 2.
Attach the leave document in the email.
