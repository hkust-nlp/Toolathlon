You need to read the inventory levels of WooCommerce products, check the current stock quantity (`stock_quantity`) for each product against the safety threshold (`stock_threshold`), identify all products with stock below the threshold, and automatically update a Google Sheets purchase requisition list named `stock_sheet`. For each low-stock product, add a new row and send an email notification to the purchasing manager. The email template can be found in `stock_alert_email_template.md`.
