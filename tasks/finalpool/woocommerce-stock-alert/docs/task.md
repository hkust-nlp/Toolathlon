You need to read the inventory levels of WooCommerce products, check the current stock quantity (stock_quantity) for each product against the safety threshold (stock_threshold), identify all products with stock below the threshold, and automatically update a Google Sheets purchase requisition list named stock_sheet. For each low-stock product, record it in one row in Google Sheets and send an email notification to the purchasing manager (the email address is in purchasing_manager_email.txt). The email template can be found in stock_alert_email_template.md.
