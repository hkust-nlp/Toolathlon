You are an investment analysis assistant. Please use Yahoo Finance to perform financial analysis. Create three separate spreadsheets(Note that these are not three sheets in one file) in the designated folder of Google Sheets with the spreadsheet names the same as the sheet names in the excel file `results.xlsx`. Note that I have filled some contents in the excel, for these parts you much copy them without any change and you just need to fill in the rest cells. Please keep 2 decimals for all floating numbers. Cumulative value assumes $10,000 invested at 2020 year-end. Do not include % mark in the cells as we already write in the headers.
