I am a housewife, and I need to prepare our family's dinner today. Based on the ingredients we currently have (located in the `ingredients.csv` file in the workspace), please recommend 3 dishes for us to cover the current ingredients as much as possible and fill the `cuisine.json`. Besides, tell me which ingredients or tools are required and list the shopping list for me. The shopping list needs to be written into the workspace. You need to help me create a new file named `shopping.csv`, containing two columns: 'Name' and 'Quantity'.
