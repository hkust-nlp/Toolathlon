I am a housewife, and I need to prepare our family's dinner today. Based on the ingredients we currently have (located in the ingredients.csv file in the workspace), please recommend 3 dishes for us. Please put the recommended three dishes in the workspace, named cuisine.md, Only put the names of dishes you recommend on the menu. Besides, tell me which ingredients are missing. In the final answer, please list the shopping list for me. The shopping list needs to be written into the workspace. You need to help me create a new file named shopping.csv, containing two columns: 'Ingredient Name' and 'Quantity'.
