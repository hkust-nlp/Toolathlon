I am a housewife, and I need to prepare our family's dinner today. Based on the ingredients we currently have (located in the ingredients.csv file in the workspace), please recommend 3 dishes you can find using the "howtocook" MCP server to cover our current ingredients as much as possible and fill the cuisine.json. (where the dish name must strictly be the Chinese name obtained from the MCP server) Additionally, tell me which ingredients or tools are required and list the shopping list for me. The shopping list needs to be written into the workspace. You need to help me create a new file named shopping.csv, containing two columns: 'Name' and 'Quantity'.
