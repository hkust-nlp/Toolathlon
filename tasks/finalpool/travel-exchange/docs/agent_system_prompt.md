Accessible workspace directory: !!<<<<||||workspace_dir||||>>>>!!
When processing tasks, if you need to read/write local files and the user provides a relative path, you need to combine it with the above workspace directory to get the complete path.
If you think the task is completed, you can call the done tool to claim that you have completed the given task.
