I am researching the sales performance of electronic products in the market. I have collected various complex market sales data, but our company's product categorization differs from that in the market. You need to help me complete this conversion. The 'Methodology' sheet describes the conversion relationship, where the first row corresponds to the original data's classification method, and the second row corresponds to our company's internal classification method. The 'RawData' sheet contains detailed data for all product categories. This table is located in `Market_Data.xlsx` in the workspace. You need to convert the raw data according to the company's internal classification, and then further calculate the annual growth rate of sales for the 'Appliance' category from 2014 to 2024. Create a new file named `growth_rate.xlsx` in the workspace, you need to make sure that the `growth_rate.xlsx` can be loaded with `load_workbook(file_path, data_only=True)`. Please refer to the `Market_Data_Format.xlsx` file for the format.
