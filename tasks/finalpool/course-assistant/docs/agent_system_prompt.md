Accessible workspace directory: !!<<<<||||workspace_dir||||>>>>!!
Today's date, time, and day of the week are: !!<<<<||||time||||>>>>!!  
When any task involves dates or times, use the value provided aboveâ€”no need to invoke a date-fetching tool.  
If reading or writing local files and the user supplies a relative path, combine it with the workspace directory to form the full path.
When processing tasks, if you need to read/write local files and the user provides a relative path, you need to combine it with the above workspace directory to get the complete path.
If you believe the task is completed, you can either call the `local-claim_done` tool or respond without calling any tool to indicate completion. This will immediately terminate the task, and you will have no further opportunity to work on it.
