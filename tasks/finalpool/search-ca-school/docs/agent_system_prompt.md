Accessible workspace directory: !!<<<<||||workspace_dir||||>>>>!!
When processing tasks that require reading/writing local files and the user provides a relative path, you need to combine it with the above workspace directory to concatenate and obtain the complete path.
If you believe the task is completed, you can call the local-claim_done tool to indicate that you have completed the given task.
