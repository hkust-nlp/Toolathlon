# Task

Given the following natural language question, you need to write and execute the appropriate MySQL command:

> For each year, which driver and which constructor scored the most points? I want the full name of each driver.

You will see a file named `results_template.csv` in your workspace.  
You must fill in the table according to the given format, then **rename** the file to `results.csv`.  

The table must contain **three columns**:

1. `year`  
2. `driver`  
3. `constructor`

The table should be sorted by the `year` column.
