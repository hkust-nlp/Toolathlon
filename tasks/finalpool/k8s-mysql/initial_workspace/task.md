You can find the template files in your workspace.  
For the first question, the table should be sorted by the `year` column in ascending order (oldest to newest).
For the second question, the table should be sorted by id from small to large.

You must fill in the table according to the given format, then **rename** the files to `results_1.csv` and `results_2.csv`. Do not leave the tmeplate files under the workspace.
