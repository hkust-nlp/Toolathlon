I need to debug the **f1** database in the `data` namespace of my Kubernetes cluster.  
A read-only account has already been created:  

- **Username:** `reader`  
- **Password:** `mcpbench0606`  

Access the database through this read-only account using a secure connection(port forward) and finish the task given in the `task.md` in the workspace.
