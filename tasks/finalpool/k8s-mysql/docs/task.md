I need to debug the **f1** database in the `data` namespace of my Kubernetes cluster.  
A read-only account has already been created:  

- **Username:** `reader`  
- **Password:** `mcpbench0606`  

Please set a port forward on port 30124 for this database and finish the task in `task.md`, please keep the port forword alive even after you finish the whole task.
