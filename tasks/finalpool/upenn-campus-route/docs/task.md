I am currently at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) Bookstore. I would like to take a walking tour of the campus attractions. A few days ago, I saw the introduction to UPenn's famous sights in the `recommendation.md` file (located in the workspace) and was very impressed. Please help me plan the shortest walking route and provide the visiting order. I want to visit all the attractions described in `recommendation.md`. Please save the final route plan to a file named `upenn_route_plan.json`, using the format from `format.json` in the workspace.
