I am currently at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) Bookstore. I would like to take a walking tour of the campus attractions. A few days ago, I saw the introduction to UPenn's famous sights in the recommendation.md file (located in the workspace) and was very impressed. Please help me plan the shortest walking route and provide the visiting order. I want to visit all the attractions described in recommendation.md (you must list each individual attraction separately, even if they are very close to each other). Please save the final route plan to a file named upenn_route_plan.json, using the format from format.json in the workspace. We only consider the time spent walking between attractions and not the time spent staying at the attractions.
