As an operator of the WooCommerce e-commerce platform, you need to send emails to customers about new product reservations and discount reminders. Specifically, this includes sending new products scheduled to be released within the next 30 days to customers who have subscribed to the automatic reservation reminder service (i.e. the potential meta data "subscription_preferences" includes "new_product_alerts" as True, default is False), as well as sending discount product reminder emails to all customers.
