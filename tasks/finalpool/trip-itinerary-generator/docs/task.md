I plan to go on vacation to Paris soon. Please help me create a two-day Paris travel itinerary for next Monday and Tuesday based on the list of attractions in **'my_wishlist.txt'**. I will start from Notre Dame Cathedral. On the first day, I **only** want to visit attractions in the Rive Droite, and on the second day, I want to see the rest. For the entire trip, I would like to walk everywhere. Please choose the shortest and fastest possible walking route between attractions. Please help me plan the itinerary with a reasonable route for both days, and save it as **'Paris_Itinerary.json'**, strictly following the format in **'format.json'**. For the last destination of each day, `"distance_to_next"` should be recorded as `null`. `"opening_hours"` should be filled in with the opening hours for that day. The filled destination names should be 100% identical to the ones in my wishlist.
