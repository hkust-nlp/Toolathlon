Please help me organize and complete the **Vision Language Model (VLM) History** materials inside a Google Sheet.

Here is the link to the current table:  
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gc6yse74XCwBx028HV_cvdxwXkmXejVjkO-Mz2uwE0k/edit?gid=528700476#gid=528700476   

The sheet is missing two columns: **“Architecture”** and **“Sources”**.

1. Copy this sheet into the target workspace folder:  
   https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1LYqmSCIlY0NmHtFJwF3Mh1RTb81RWHvU?ths=true 

2. For each model in the copied sheet, populate the new columns as follows:
   - **Architecture**: Provide a concise technical description of the model’s architecture.  
     Refer to `Architecture.txt` in the workspace for the required format and terminology.
   - **Sources**: Follow the rules defined in `Order.txt` inside the same workspace.
   - If the information is not publicly available, enter **“unavailable”**.
