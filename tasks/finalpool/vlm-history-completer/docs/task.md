Please help me organize and complete the development history of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in a Google Sheet.
The spreadsheet at this link, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gc6yse74XCwBx028HV_cvdxwXkmXejVjkO-Mz2uwE0k/edit?gid=528700476#gid=528700476, contains a history of VLMs, but it is missing the "Architecture" and "Sources" columns.
I need you to copy this spreadsheet to the target work folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1buGDXqHfaehm-zMPHjuyEePVURkOQfhB?ths=true, name the new file `VLM-History`, research the models listed, and then populate the following columns in the newly created sheet:
- **Architecture column:** Fill in a description of each model's technical architecture. You can refer to the `Architecture.txt` file in the workspace for the specific types of descriptions required.
- **Sources column:** The requirements for filling this column are outlined in the `Order.txt` file in the workspace.
- If any information is not publicly available, please enter "unavailable".
