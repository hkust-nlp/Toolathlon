Please help me organize and complete the development history of Vision Language Models (VLMs) in the `Text and Image` worksheet of `Directory of Generative AI` spreadsheet. It misses the "Architecture" and "Sources" columns.
So I need you to research the models listed, and then populate the following columns in the same worksheet:
- **Architecture column:** Fill in a description of each model's technical architecture. You can refer to the `Architecture.txt` file in the workspace for the specific types of descriptions required.
- **Sources column:** The requirements for filling this column are outlined in the `Order.txt` file in the workspace.
- If any information is not publicly available, please enter "unavailable".
