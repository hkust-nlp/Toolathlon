Please scan the workspace folder, pick the model checkpoint with the highest eval_accuracy, then push the best model's folder to Hugging Face Hub as a model repo named `MyAwesomeModel-TestRepo`. 

Finalize the repo's `README.md` with the detailed evaluation results for all 15 benchmarks (keep three decimal places), you must refer to the current `README.md` under workspace and ensure its completeness in the uploaded repo. Do not change any other content in the `README.md` besides the benchmark scores.

You can use the `hf_token.txt` under the workspace if necessary.
