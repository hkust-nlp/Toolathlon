# NLP Summer Course Syllabus

## Course Overview

Welcome to the Summer Natural Language Processing course! This 8-week intensive program introduces students to fundamental and advanced concepts in NLP, from text preprocessing to state-of-the-art transformer models. Through hands-on practice with real-world applications, you will learn to build systems that can understand, process, and generate human language.

The course covers essential topics including tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, text classification, sentiment analysis, and language modeling. We will work with popular Python libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, and Hugging Face Transformers. By the end of this course, you will have practical experience implementing NLP solutions and a solid foundation for further exploration in this rapidly evolving field.
