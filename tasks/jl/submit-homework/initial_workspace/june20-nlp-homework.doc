NLP Project Proposal: Sentiment Analysis for Product Reviews

1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis system for online product reviews using transformer-based models. The system will classify customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral to help businesses better understand customer feedback.

2. Problem Statement
Online retailers receive thousands of product reviews daily, making manual analysis impractical. An automated sentiment analysis system can help companies quickly identify customer satisfaction trends and respond to negative feedback promptly.

3. Methodology
- Use pre-trained transformer models (BERT or RoBERTa) from Hugging Face
- Fine-tune the model on product review datasets
- Implement text preprocessing including tokenization and normalization
- Apply classification techniques for sentiment prediction

4. Dataset
- Amazon product reviews dataset
- Training set: 50,000 reviews
- Test set: 10,000 reviews
- Labels: positive, negative, neutral

5. Expected Outcomes
- Achieve 85%+ accuracy on sentiment classification
- Create a user-friendly interface for real-time review analysis
- Generate sentiment distribution reports for business insights

6. Timeline
- Week 1-2: Data collection and preprocessing
- Week 3-4: Model training and fine-tuning
- Week 5: Evaluation and testing
- Week 6: Interface development and final report

This project will demonstrate practical application of transformer models for real-world business problems while providing hands-on experience with modern NLP techniques.
