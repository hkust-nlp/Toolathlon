It's exam week now, and today is January 6, 2025.
 Login Canvas by localhost:10001 link, with email and secret in memory. Check the announcements in Canvas for information and compile a list of the remaining exams you need to take. I write an example in the exam_schedule.xlsx in the workspace, complish the exam details in chronological order based on the exam schedule.
If any exam information hasn't been released yet, mark it as "TBD".
