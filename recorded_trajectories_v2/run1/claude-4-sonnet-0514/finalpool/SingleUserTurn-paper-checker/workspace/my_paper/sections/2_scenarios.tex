\section{Scenarios where tools are useful}
\label{sec:scenarios}

While LMs may easily learn to do many tasks to high accuracy without tools, many other tasks greatly benefit from tool use.
In this section, we study a broad range of scenarios where tools have been used to assist agents. We discuss tasks where human-created, application-specific tools can improve their performance or other positive aspects (\S\ref{sub:app-spec}), as well as scenarios where tools may not be as useful (\S\ref{sub:not-useful}). 



\subsection{Utilizing existing tools for specific applications}
\label{sub:app-spec}

While it is difficult to exhaustively enumerate every scenario where tools could be useful, we summarize some major categories of tool use in \autoref{tab:example-tools} and below.
Note that a tool may fall into one or more categories.


\noindent \textbf{\raisebox{-1mm}{\includegraphics[width=4mm]{./figures/icon/book-icon.png}} Knowledge access} \quad
% unstructured text & structured kb/kg
LMs store limited knowledge during training due to both limits in (i) the data that they are trained on and (ii) the ability of LMs to accurately memorize and utilize all of the data that they see at training time.
Several varieties of tools can be used to alleviate this issue.
\texttt{SQL} and \texttt{SPARL} executors can provide access to data in structured knowledge bases \citep{thoppilan2022lamda,parisi2022talm,hao2023toolkengpt} or knowledge graphs \citep{zhuang2023toolqa}.
An \texttt{search engine} tool  over the Internet \citep{yao2023react,schick2023toolformer,paranjape2023art} can enable LMs to access more up-to-date information \citep{komeili-etal-2022-internet,lazaridou2022internetaugmented}.
More generally, retrieval-augmented generation systems \citep{asai2023retrieval} can be seen as using a \texttt{retriever} tool \citep{mialon2023augmented}.


\noindent \textbf{\raisebox{-0.5mm}{\includegraphics[width=4mm]{./figures/icon/work-icon.png}} Computation activities} \quad
% math
Complex computing activities such as math calculations are known to be challenging for neural LMs \citep{schick2023toolformer}. While even a \texttt{calculator} can enhance LMs' numeracy abilities \citep{parisi2022talm,hao2023toolkengpt}, more generic \texttt{Python} programs are also employed to aid reasoning tasks \citep{gao2023pal,chen2023program,wang2023mint}.
% business tools
For more complex professional jobs, business tools are also applied, such as using \texttt{worksheet} to manipulate Google Sheets \citep{xu2023tool}, or even tools for financial, medical, education, or advertising domains \citep{tang2023toolalpaca,huang2024metatool}.


\noindent \textbf{\raisebox{-0.5mm}{\includegraphics[width=4mm]{./figures/icon/world-icon.png}} Interaction with the world} \quad
LMs without tools are fundamentally unable to perceive and act in the world around them, necessitating tool use where such perception and action is necessary. For instance, LMs can access real-time information such as weather \citep{xu2023tool,tang2023toolalpaca}, or positional knowledge such as location \citep{qin2023toolllm}. On the other hand, LMs can manipulate real-world information such as managing calendars \citep{schick2023toolformer} and emails \citep{qin2023toolllm}.
In addition to web-based activities, LMs can engage in physical activities in embodied environments, such as fishing with rods or mining with axes in the Minecraft world \citep{wang2023voyager}; further propagate to the real-world tasks to perform cooking \citep{singh2022progprompt,shridhar2020alfred}, plotting \citep{liang2023code}, and even conducting chemical research \citep{boiko2023autonomous}.


\noindent \textbf{\raisebox{-0.5mm}{\includegraphics[width=4mm]{./figures/icon/media-icon.png}} Non-textual modalities} \quad
While many LMs only consume and generate texts, some works bring in access to visual \citep{gupta2022visual,suris2023vipergpt}, audio \citep{yang2023mmreact,gao2023assistgpt}, or other modalities. For example, LMs can access images with \texttt{cat\_image} APIs \citep{xu2023tool,tang2023toolalpaca} or songs \citep{huang2024metatool} provided by \texttt{spotify}, even answer questions about them \citep{gupta2022visual,gao2023assistgpt}.


\noindent \textbf{\raisebox{-0.5mm}{\includegraphics[width=4mm]{./figures/icon/brain-icon.png}} Accessing specialized LMs} \quad
Some works propose to use specialized LMs as tools, essentially using the main LM as a task planner to dispatch requests to other LMs.
\citet{schick2023toolformer} propose QA models to fill in factoid details in responses, \citet{thoppilan2022lamda,schick2023toolformer,paranjape2023art} use machine translation models to assist multilingual tasks. Beyond specific tasks, some works adopt multiple neural models from Hugginface or similar platforms \citep{patil2023gorilla,shen2023hugginggpt}, or further fine-tune them on various data \citep{viswanathan2023prompt2model}.
Compared to the base LM, these tool models mainly vary in their specialized skills, and may or may not have substantial architectural differences from the base LMs.


\subsection{Where are tools \emph{not} useful?}
\label{sub:not-useful}

Despite the fact that tools can be helpful under many scenarios discussed above, it is also important to note scenarios where tools are arguably not very helpful.
Some examples of tasks where tools have not (yet) been used to great effect include machine translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis (among others).
These are tasks that are not easy to perform using non-ML methods (c.f.~solving math problems or accessing databases, which can be done using a calculator or SQL), and can be performed with high accuracy by a powerful LM alone.
One intuitive reason is that the tools currently leveraged for these tasks are \textit{neural networks} and have limited advantages over the base LM.
Imagine if we leverage tools on these tasks, the tools would mostly generally be another neural LM with specialized skills, e.g., an LM specifically trained on many summarization datasets to perform this task. However, this special-skilled neural LM may not have significant architectural differences from the base tool-using LM, or be smaller in size or training tokens hence having inferior language modeling abilities in general.
In comparison, the base LM capable of solution planning and tool management, usually are more powerful (e.g., GPT-4) and can achieve reasonable performance on a wide variety of tasks, perhaps even outperforming special-purpose LMs \citep{robinson-etal-2023-chatgpt}.
