\section{Final Remarks}
Our survey provides definitions for LM-used tools and systematic summaries of existing approaches. While our empirical analysis guides when (on what tasks) and how (use what methods) should one use tools, we hope readers can more clearly understand the scenarios and techniques of LM tooling, from basic paradigm to advanced settings, and across LMs speaking natural and programming languages. 
% \dfcomment{I feel like the `what methods' part was comparatively underexplored -- and rightly so, since methods are still pretty new and haven't been thoroughly compared. Maybe we should instead focus, here, on the `how-to-evaluate' aspects which we were more concrete on?}
% Further, we point out missing aspects of tool evaluation and suggest more comprehensive measurements for efficiency, performance, reliability, and safety.
We believe tools can greatly extend and facilitate LM abilities, and hope our work elicits more discussions and research developments in %this direction.
(i) proposing benchmarks with natural use cases and executable tools, (ii) utilizing comprehensive evaluation metrics proposed in \S\ref{sec:good-tool}, and (iii) exploring more challenging and realistic scenarios for tool-using and tool-making techniques.
% (i) proposing better benchmarks, methods, and evaluation metrics, as well as (ii) advanced topics empowered by tools such as more capable agents and their interactions with humans or the world.
% \dfcomment{could consider broader directions for future work here enabled by your perspective, e.g. what other sorts of things might be implemented as tools that haven't been already? (interaction with people? reads and writes from an external memory?)}
% \gncomment{I agree with Daniel's comment above. I think that more insight into future directions or missing pieces would be nice here. Right now it's basically ``better evaluation'' and ``better methods'' which isn't super-insightful -- those are always the things that we can do :)}
