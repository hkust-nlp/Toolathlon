In this work, we\\\\npropose an audio-visual pipeline to enable automatic and robust animated\\\\ncharacter recognition, and thereby enhance character-centric understanding of\\\\nanimated movies. Central to our approach is the automatic construction of an\\\\naudio-visual character bank from online sources. This bank contains both visual\\\\nexemplars and voice (audio) samples for each character, enabling subsequent\\\\nmulti-modal character recognition despite long-tailed appearance distributions.\\\\nBuilding on accurate character recognition, we explore two downstream\\\\napplications: Audio Description (AD) generation for visually impaired\\\\naudiences, and character-aware subtitling for the hearing impaired. To support\\\\nresearch in this domain, we introduce CMD-AM, a new dataset of 75 animated\\\\nmovies with comprehensive annotations. Our character-centric pipeline\\\\ndemonstrates significant improvements in both accessibility and narrative\\\\ncomprehension for animated content over prior face-detection-based approaches.\\\\nFor the code and dataset, visit\\\\nhttps://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/animated_ad/.\\\",\\n      \\\"categories\\\": [\\n        \\\"cs.CV\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"published\\\": \\\"2025-09-15T17:59:51+00:00\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12204v1\\\",\\n      \\\"resource_uri\\\": \\\"arxiv://2509.12204v1\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"2509.12203v1\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"LazyDrag: Enabling Stable Drag-Based Editing on Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers via Explicit Correspondence\\\",\\n      \\\"authors\\\": [\\n        \\\"Zixin Yin\\\",\\n        \\\"Xili Dai\\\",\\n        \\\"Duomin Wang\\\",\\n        \\\"Xianfang Zeng\\\",\\n        \\\"Lionel M.

This\\\\ncompromise severely limits the generative capabilities of diffusion models,\\\\nsuppressing high-fidelity inpainting and text-guided creation. In this paper,\\\\nwe introduce LazyDrag, the first drag-based image editing method for\\\\nMulti-Modal Diffusion Transformers, which directly eliminates the reliance on\\\\nimplicit point matching. In concrete terms, our method generates an explicit\\\\ncorrespondence map from user drag inputs as a reliable reference to boost the\\\\nattention control. This reliable reference opens the potential for a stable\\\\nfull-strength inversion process, which is the first in the drag-based editing\\\\ntask. It obviates the necessity for TTO and unlocks the generative capability\\\\nof models. Therefore, LazyDrag naturally unifies precise geometric control with\\\\ntext guidance, enabling complex edits that were previously out of reach:\\\\nopening the mouth of a dog and inpainting its interior, generating new objects\\\\nlike a ``tennis ball'', or for ambiguous drags, making context-aware changes\\\\nlike moving a hand into a pocket. Additionally, LazyDrag supports multi-round\\\\nworkflows with simultaneous move and scale operations. Evaluated on the\\\\nDragBench, our method outperforms baselines in drag accuracy and perceptual\\\\nquality, as validated by VIEScore and human evaluation. LazyDrag not only\\\\nestablishes new state-of-the-art performance, but also paves a new way to\\\\nediting paradigms.\\\",\\n      \\\"categories\\\": [\\n        \\\"cs.CV\\\"\\n      ],\\n      \\\"published\\\": \\\"2025-09-15T17:59:47+00:00\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12203v1\\\",\\n      \\\"resource_uri\\\": \\\"arxiv://2509.12203v1\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"2509.12202v1\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"High-capacity associative memory in a quantum-optical spin glass\\\",\\n      \\\"authors\\\": [\\n        \\\"Brendan P.

ICL is striking not only for its power, but\\nalso because it emerges without being explicitly trained\\nfor (as Brown et al. (2020) first observed, when training\\ntransformer models on internet-scale language corpora.).\\nNewer work has shown that ICL can sometimes in fact\\ndisappear after emerging, i.e. it can be transient over the\\ncourse of training (Singh et al., 2023; Anand et al., 2024;\\nHe et al., 2024).\\nThis evolving picture of ICL necessitates a deeper under-\\nstanding of the dynamics of ICL emergence (and transience).\\nICL is often viewed to be in competition with other strate-\\ngies (Nguyen & Reddy, 2024; Park et al., 2024), such as\\nIWL, with the tradeoff thought to be modulated by data\\nproperties (Chan et al., 2022; 2024), model size (Wei et al.,\\n2023), and/or training time (Singh et al., 2023). While com-\\npetition may explain why ICL gives way to other strategies\\nthrough the course of training, the question remains: why\\ndoes it emerge in the first place (if only to fade away)?\\nIn this work, we aim to extend the mechanistic understand-\\ning of ICL, which currently focuses on induction heads\\n(Olsson et al., 2022) and their emergence dynamics (Singh\\net al., 2024), to a richer dynamical setting involving multiple\\nstrategies cycling in and out over the course of learning. To\\ndo so, we reproduce and investigate the key transience result\\nin a simplified synthetic data setting with a 2-layer attention-\\nonly transformer. Using behavioral evaluators, we find the\\nasymptotic strategy after the disappearance of ICL is not\\npure in-weights learning. Rather, it is a surprising hybrid\\nstrategy that we term context-constrained in-weights learn-\\ning (CIWL, Section 4). The implementation of CIWL takes\\nthe form of skip-trigrams (Elhage et al., 2021) distributed\\nacross multiple heads in a form of superposition (Elhage\\net al., 2022). Perhaps even more remarkably, we find that\\neven though CIWL dominates over ICL asymptotically, both\\nstrategies share critical sub-circuits (Section 5.1), indicating\\ncooperative dynamics between these seemingly competitive\\nmechanisms—a phenomenon we term “strategy coopeti-\\ntion.” We borrow the term “coopetition” from game theory,\\nwhere it describes situations where competitors simultane-\\nously cooperate and compete with each other.1Cooperation\\n1A classic historical examples is Hollywood studios in the early\\n1arXiv:2503.05631v2  [cs.LG]  10 Mar 2025\\n\\n=== Page 2 ===\\nStrategy coopetition explains the emergence and transience of in-context learning\\n0 or\\n1\\nxTrain: 24 24Strategy used\\nICLCIWL\\nIWL:\\n37 or\\n24\\na)context queryexample\\noutputs b) c)\\nLayer 1\\n(ICL vs\\nCIWL )\\n24 37rep\\n24rep\\n3724\\nLayer 2 \\\"Induction Head\\\"\\n(ICL + CIWL ) 24\\nICL:\\nCIWL:\\nFlip:37 or\\n41\\n37\\n2441\\n 37\\n0 1\\n37\\n24\\n 37037 or\\n41\\n24\\n37 24\\nFigure 1. (a)Example sequences seen during training and evaluation. Training data is “bursty”, enabling both in-context and in-weights\\nstrategies (the context always contains an exemplar from the same class as the query, but also exemplar-label mappings are fixed throughout\\ntraining). Evaluation sequences (below dotted line) are designed to measure the presence of different strategies. ICL relies on the\\nexemplar-label mapping in context. IWL depends solely on in-weights information. CIWL requires the correct label in context, but not the\\nquery exemplar. The Flip evaluator measures the balance between ICL and CIWL (1.0 means pure ICL, 0.0 means pure CIWL). Bolding\\nindicates OOD exemplar-label pairings. Grayed outputs indicate random selection between the two in-context labels. (b)Accuracy on\\nsequences from (a), over the course of training. “In-context accuracy” is computed by restricting the network’s outputs to the two labels\\npresent in context—this ensures the same chance level (0.5) for all plotted evaluators. ICL transience is clearly visible in blue. IWL is not\\nshown, as we found little-to-no IWL in the networks (Appendix C.1). We annotate four points: 1. the formation of Layer 2 circuits, the\\ncanonical “induction head”; 2. ICL strategy dominates network output, as evidenced by peak in the Flip evaluator (red); 3. CIWL strategy\\nmatches strength of ICL, as indicated by 50% performance on Flip evaluator; 4. CIWL strategy dominates network output, leading Flip\\nevaluator (red) to be 0 and CIWL evaluator (green) to be 1. (c)Illustration of competitive (Layer 1) and cooperative (Layer 2) interactions\\nwe find between ICL and CIWL strategies. Both strategies are present in varying amounts through training, as represented by the varying\\nline weights in the Layer 1 circuits: when Layer 1 acts as previous token heads, the network exhibits ICL, but when Layer 1 heads attend\\nto self, the network exhibits CIWL. Crucially, the computation in Layer 2 remains largely unchanged after its initial formation, despite the\\nstrategy switch from ICL to CIWL.\\nenables the emergence of ICL (despite it not being asymp-\\ntotically preferred), while competition leads to its eventual\\ntransience (as previously indicated by Singh et al. (2023)).\\nNotably, ICL emergence can only occur when CIWL is not\\nfully formed (Section 5.4), which may explain the tradeoff\\nseen by Chan et al. (2022): under certain data properties,\\nCIWL forms too “quickly,” preventing ICL emergence.\\nWe formalize our intuitions from this case study into a min-\\nimal mathematical model capturing coopetition dynamics\\nand explaining the transience behavior. Our model moti-\\nvates further experiments to modulate the tradeoff between\\nstrategies through learning, like reducing the asymptotic\\nbias towards one strategy via data properties. For the case\\nof ICL vs CIWL, we find that matching context and query\\nexemplars removes the asymptotic bias towards CIWL and\\nleads to the persistence of the “faster” ICL strategy.\\nOur work represents a step forward in understanding how\\ndifferent strategies trade off during learning, through mech-\\nanistic investigations on the transience of ICL. We hope our\\nwork inspires further work on such coopetitive, dynamical\\nphenomena and enhances intuitions around how capabilities\\nemerge (and possibly fade) when training transformers.\\n20th century, who competed aggressively for talent and audiences,\\nbut also collaborated to establish industry-wide standards and\\njointly negotiate with labor unions.2.

Introduction\\nModel immunization, recently proposed by Zheng & Yeh\\n(2024), studies how to pre-train a model that is more difficult\\nto fine-tune on harmful content, but not others. The aim\\nis to mitigate the risk of misuse (Brundage et al., 2018;\\nMarchal et al., 2024) associated with open-sourced models\\nby immunizing them before they are released to the public.\\nZheng & Yeh (2024) focus on immunizing text-to-image\\nmodels, where they formulate immunization as a bi-level op-\\ntimization. Empirically, they show that pre-trained diffusion\\nmodels that undergo immunization are more difficult to fine-\\ntune on a given harmful concept dataset. To quantify this\\ndifficulty, they compare the generation quality of models\\nwith and without immunization after a fixed number of fine-\\ntuning iterations. While the empirical results are promising,\\n*Equal contribution1Department of Computer Science,\\nPurdue University. Correspondence to: Raymond A.

Copyright 2025\\nby the author(s).a definition of an immunized model and the circumstances\\nthat make immunization possible remain unclear.\\nTo tackle this issue, we propose a framework to study\\nmodel immunization using the condition number (Gloub\\n& Van Loan, 1996). The effectiveness of immunization can\\nbe characterized by the condition number of the Hessian\\nmatrix. When using gradient-based methods during fine-\\ntuning, a condition number closer to one indicates faster\\nconvergence (Boyd & Vandenberghe, 2004), i.e., easier to\\nfine-tune. With this perspective, we observe that the ex-\\nistence of an effective immunization for linear models is\\nrelated to the angle between the singular vectors of the\\nharmful fine-tuning dataset’s covariance matrix and the pre-\\ntraining dataset’s covariance matrix.\\nFrom this condition number perspective, we propose an\\nimmunization algorithm to find such a model. In detail,\\nwe propose two additional terms to regularize the condi-\\ntion number during pre-training. Each of the introduced\\nregularization terms can be shown to ensure a monotonic\\nincrease/decrease of the condition number under gradient\\nupdates.\\nBeyond the theoretical results, we empirically validate the\\nproposed algorithm on linear models for regression and\\nimage classification tasks. Lastly, we conduct experiments\\nusing the proposed algorithm on non-linear models, i.e.,\\ndeep-nets. Despite the gap in theory, we observe that the\\nproposed approach remains effective at model immunization\\nacross ResNet (He et al., 2016) and ViT (Dosovitskiy, 2021).\\nOur contributions are summarized as follows:\\n•We introduce a framework based on the condition number\\nto study the task of model immunization. This framework\\nleads to a concrete definition of an immunized model\\nalong with a novel experiment setup and evaluation met-\\nric to compare the quality of different immunization tech-\\nniques.\\n•We propose regularizers to maximize/minimize the con-\\ndition number, with a guaranteed monotonic increase/de-\\ncrease when updated with the gradient-based method.\\n•Together with the task objective and regularizers, we\\ndemonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively im-\\nmunizes linear models and deep-nets on regression/image\\nclassification tasks.\\n1\",\"annotations\":null}", "type": "function_call_output"}}

Introduction\\nProbability measures provide a powerful way to represent\\nmany data types. For instance, they allow to naturally repre-\\nsent documents (Kusner et al., 2015), genes (Bellazzi et al.,\\n2021), point clouds (Qi et al., 2017; Geuter et al., 2025),\\nimages (Sodini et al., 2025), or single-cell data (Persad et al.,\\n*Equal contribution1ENSAE, CREST, IP Paris2Universit ´e\\nParis-Saclay, Laboratoire de Math ´ematique d’Orsay. Correspon-\\ndence to: Cl ´ement Bonet <clement.bonet@ensae.fr >, Chrisophe\\nVauthier <christophe.vauthier@universite-paris-saclay.fr >.\\nProceedings of the 42ndInternational Conference on Machine\\nLearning , Vancouver, Canada. PMLR 267, 2025. Copyright 2025\\nby the author(s).2023; Haviv et al., 2024b). Remarkably, it has been shown\\nthat one can embed any finite dataset with little or no distor-\\ntion (Andoni et al., 2018; Kratsios et al., 2023) in the Wasser-\\nstein space, i.e., the space of probability distributions ( e.g.,\\nover a Euclidean space) equipped with the Wasserstein-2 dis-\\ntance from Optimal Transport (OT). This has motivated the\\nuse of this space to embed many types of data ranging from\\nwords (Vilnis & McCallum, 2015) to knowledge graphs\\n(He et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2022), graphs (Bojchevski &\\nG¨unnemann, 2018; Petric Maretic et al., 2019), or neuro-\\nscience data (Bonet et al., 2023). Therefore, it is essential to\\ndevelop tools to work on the space of probability measures\\nover probability measures, also known as random measures.\\nIn particular, they provide a natural way to represent labeled\\ndatasets as mixtures (Alvarez-Melis & Fusi, 2020).\\nA natural distance on this space is the Wasserstein over\\nWasserstein distance (WoW) (Nguyen, 2016; Catalano\\n& Lavenant, 2024), also known as the Hierarchical OT\\ndistance, which lifts the Wasserstein distance between prob-\\nability distributions as a ground cost, to define a Wasserstein\\ndistance between random measures. The latter has been used\\nfor generative modeling applications (Dukler et al., 2019),\\ndomain adaptation tasks (El Hamri et al., 2022), comparing\\ndocuments (Yurochkin et al., 2019) or multilevel clustering\\n(Ho et al., 2017). It has also been used to compare Gaussian\\nmixtures (Chen et al., 2018; Delon & Desolneux, 2020;\\nWilson et al., 2024) or generic mixtures (Dusson et al., 2023;\\nChen & Zhang, 2024). However, its poor sample complexity\\nhas motivated the development of alternative distance mea-\\nsures, such as those based on Integral Probability Metrics\\n(Catalano & Lavenant, 2024). Nonetheless, this space pos-\\nsesses a rich Riemannian structure, enabling the definition\\nof concepts like geodesics. This has been leveraged recently\\nby Haviv et al. (2024a) to perform generative modeling over\\nthe space of probability distributions with Flow Matchings.\\nWhile this space naturally supports a range of machine learn-\\ning tasks, optimization methods tailored to it have received\\nlimited attention. Yet, this is important for multiple ap-\\nplications, including variational inference with a Gaussian\\nmixture family (Lambert et al., 2022; Huix et al., 2024),\\ncomputing barycenters (Delon & Desolneux, 2020), or flow-\\ning datasets (Alvarez-Melis & Fusi, 2021), e.g., for domain\\nadaptation, transfer learning (Alvarez-Melis & Fusi, 2021;\\nHua et al., 2023) or dataset distillation (Wang et al., 2018).\\n1\",\"annotations\":null}", "type": "function_call_output"}}

This “model-free” embedding\\nhas been successfully leveraged to build multi-\\nple domain-agnostic machine learning (ML) al-\\ngorithms for time series and sequential data. The\\nconvergence results proved in this paper bridge\\nthe gap between the expected signature’s em-\\npirical discrete-time estimator and its theoreti-\\ncal continuous-time value, allowing for a more\\ncomplete probabilistic interpretation of expected\\nsignature-based ML methods. Moreover, when\\nthe data generating process is a martingale, we\\nsuggest a simple modification of the expected sig-\\nnature estimator with significantly lower mean\\nsquared error and empirically demonstrate how it\\ncan be effectively applied to improve predictive\\nperformance.\\n1. Introduction\\nThe signature transform of a stream of data is an infinite but\\ncountable sequence of its “iterated integrals” summarizing\\nthe input in a top-down fashion, meaning the informational\\ncontent of its terms decays factorially. Originally introduced\\nby Chen (1954) and serving as a fundamental object of\\nrough path analysis (Lyons et al., 2007), the signature\\nS={S(X)[0,t]∈T((Rd)), t∈[0, T]},\\nof a path X={Xt, t∈[0, T]} ∈C([0, T],Rd)is a lift\\n(in the sense that it embeds X) to the space of continuous\\nfunctions over the tensor algebra T((Rd))possessing some\\nnice algebraic and geometric properties. When the path is of\\nbounded variation, the signature is defined as the sequence\\n1Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, Lon-\\ndon, United Kingdom.

In this setting, two funda-\\nmental properties of the signature that make it a desirable\\nnon-parametric feature extraction method for sequential\\ndata are the characterization result of Hambly & Lyons\\n(2005) and the universality approximation theorem of Levin\\net al. (2016). Moreover, when the path Xis understood\\nas a (realization of a) random process with distribution P\\nover BV([0, T],Rd), the shuffle property of the signature\\nimplies that all moments of the random variable S(X)[0,T]\\nare determined by its expectation\\nϕ(T) :=E[S(X)[0,T]]∈T((Rd)).\\nA natural question, known as the Hamburger moment prob-\\nlem (Fawcett, 2003), is thus whether the expectation of\\nthe signature characterizes its law (and thus the law of the\\npath). When imposing a probability distribution PonX\\nthe assumption of bounded variation paths becomes quite\\nrestrictive: Brownian motion, the basic building block of\\nmany stochastic models, has paths of infinite variation al-\\nmost surely. Even if we observe a discrete-time stream of\\ndata, we often still would like to define the process Xas\\na latent stochastic process of which we observe the linear\\ninterpolation over some partition πof[0, T], hereafter de-\\nnoted by Xπ. We hence wish to make sense of the signature\\nof a stochastic process Xwith paths of unbounded variation.\\nFor a given path X∈C([0, T],Rd)of finite p-variation,\\nonce we “lift” the process to a p-rough path (Lyons et al.,\\n2007, Definition 3.11) then the signature SofXis uniquely\\ndefined1. Without delving into the details of rough path\\ntheory, for our purposes it suffices to interpret the choice of\\nlift as fixing a notion of integration with respect to X: the\\nhigher order signatures terms are then understood as iterated\\nintegrals of the path Xdefined in this sense.\\n1This is the first fundamental theorem in the theory of rough\\npaths (Lyons et al., 2007, Theorem 3.7).\\n1\",\"annotations\":null}", "type": "function_call_output"}}

Copyright 2025\\nby the author(s).1. Introduction\\nAutomated machine learning (AutoML) has significantly\\nreduced the need for technical expertise and human labors\\nin developing effective data-driven solutions by automating\\neach process in the AI development pipeline (Yao et al.,\\n2018; Ren et al., 2020; He et al., 2021), such as feature\\nengineering, model selection, and hyperparameter optimiza-\\ntion (HPO). However, current AutoML systems (Gijsbers\\net al., 2024) often necessitate programming expertise to\\nconfigure complex tools and resources, potentially creating\\nbarriers for a larger pool of users with limited skills and\\nknowledge, such as domain experts (Sun et al. (2023); §A).\\nTo make AutoML frameworks more accessible to non-expert\\nusers, many recent studies (Trirat et al., 2021; Viswanathan\\net al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Hollmann et al., 2023b; Liu\\net al., 2025; Zhang et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhang\\net al., 2024a; Hong et al., 2024a; Guo et al., 2024a; Yang\\net al., 2025; Chi et al., 2024) have suggested to use natural\\nlanguage interfaces with large language models (LLM) for\\nmachine learning (ML) and data science (DS) tasks. Nev-\\nertheless, these previous LLM-based AutoML frameworks\\nonly considered a limited number of tasks due to their re-\\nstricted designs, either only for a process in the pipeline (e.g.,\\nfeature engineering (Hollmann et al., 2023b; Li et al., 2024;\\nMalberg et al., 2024), HPO (Liu et al., 2024a; 2025; Zhang\\net al., 2024a), and model selection (Zhang et al., 2023; Shen\\net al., 2023)) or for a specific group of downstream tasks\\n(e.g., natural language processing (Viswanathan et al., 2023)\\nand computer vision (Yang et al., 2025)). In addition, most\\nmethods overlook the inherent capability of LLMs to search\\nfor promising models by performing actual training of the\\ncandidate models during the search process, making it pro-\\nhibitively costly and slow.\\nFor an AutoML framework to be truly practical, it should\\nperform end-to-end AutoML, considering both the data\\naspects (retrieval, preprocessing, and feature engineering)\\nandmodel aspects (selection, HPO, and deployment). This\\nis because a process in one aspect can affect subsequent\\nprocesses in the other, potentially leading to suboptimal so-\\nlutions when combining results from different frameworks.\\nMeanwhile, the AutoML framework should be computation-\\nally efficient, using strategies to minimize the computational\\noverhead during search. However, there are two main chal-\\nlenges in building such a framework.\\n1\",\"annotations\":null}", "type": "function_call_output"}}

Lawrence Zitnick1\\n1Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) at Meta\\nMachine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become increasingly effective at approximating\\nquantum mechanical calculations at a fraction of the computational cost. However, lower errors\\non held out test sets do not always translate to improved results on downstream physical property\\nprediction tasks. We propose testing MLIPs on their practical ability to conserve energy during\\nmolecular dynamic simulations. If passed, improved correlations are found between test errors and\\ntheir performance on physical property prediction tasks. We identify choices which may lead to\\nmodels failing this test, and use these observations to improve upon highly-expressive models. The\\nresulting model, eSEN, provides state-of-the-art results on a range of physical property prediction tasks,\\nincluding materials stability prediction, thermal conductivity prediction, and phonon calculations.\\nCorrespondence: Xiang Fu ( xiangfu@meta.com ) and C. Lawrence Zitnick ( zitnick@meta.com )\\nCode: https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairchem\\nCheckpoints: https://huggingface.co/facebook/OMAT24\\n1 Introduction\\nDensity Functional Theory (DFT), which models the\\nelectrons in materials and molecules, serves as the\\nfoundation for many modern drug and materials dis-\\ncovery workflows. Unfortunately, DFT calculations\\nare notoriously computationally intensive, scaling\\ncubically with the number of electrons in the sys-\\ntem: O(n3). Machine learning interatomic potentials\\n(MLIPs) are promising in approximating and expe-\\nditing DFT calculations. With increasing data set\\nsizes and model innovations, MLIPs have shown sub-\\nstantial improvements in accuracy and generalization\\ncapabilities (Batatia et al., 2023; Merchant et al.,\\n2023; Yang et al., 2024; Barroso-Luque et al., 2024).\\nPredicting physical properties in chemistry and ma-\\nterials science often requires complex workflows in-\\nvolving numerous evaluations of DFT or MLIPs. For\\nexample, in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,\\nforces are predicted over thousands to millions of\\ntime steps. However, the MLIP literature has mostly\\nfocused on assessing models based on energy and\\nforce predictions over static DFT test sets rather\\nthan directly assessing their performance in complex\\nsimulations. This approach has limitations, as im-\\nproved accuracy on test sets does not always lead to\\nbetter predictions of physical properties (Póta et al.,\\n2024; Loew et al., 2024).In this paper, we address two questions: Why does\\nhigher test accuracy sometimes fail to enhance a\\nmodel’s ability to predict physical properties, and\\nhow can we improve MLIPs to excel in this area? We\\nfirst outline four critical property prediction tasks\\nand identify the properties required for an MLIP\\nto succeed in these tasks. These properties entail\\nlearning a conservative model with continuous and\\nbounded energy derivatives, indicating a smoothly-\\nvarying and physically meaningful energy landscape.\\nTo test whether these properties hold, we propose\\ntesting the ability of MLIPs to practically conserve\\nenergy in MD simulations. We demonstrate models\\nthat pass this test have a higher correlation between\\ntest errors and property prediction accuracy.\\nBuilding on these insights, we present a novel MLIP\\ncalled eSEN and training approach that achieves\\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex\\nproperty prediction tasks. Specifically, our model\\nis capable of running energy-conserving MD simula-\\ntions for out-of-distribution systems (Figure 1 (a)).\\nFor materials stability prediction, eSEN achieves a\\nleading F1 score of 0.831and a κSRMEof0.340on the\\ncompliant Matbench-Discovery benchmark (Riebe-\\nsell et al., 2023; Póta et al., 2024). Previous models\\nare only able to excel in one of these metrics ( Fig-\\nure 1 (b,c)). We also achieve a SOTA F1 score of\\n0.925andκSRMEof0.170on the non-compliant cate-\\n1arXiv:2502.12147v2  [physics.comp-ph]  23 Apr 2025\",\"annotations\":null}", "type": "function_call_output"}}

Building upon the success of single\\nagents, researchers have demonstrated that combining mul-\\ntiple agents, either cooperatively (Zhuge et al., 2024) or\\ncompetitively (Zhao et al., 2023), can surpass the cognitive\\nand intellectual capabilities of individuals (Du et al., 2023;\\nLiang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b; Jiang et al., 2023; Wu\\net al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024a), showcasing the collective\\nintelligence in a society of LLM-agents (Piatti et al., 2024).\\nEarly multi-agent systems, such as CAMEL (Li et al., 2023),\\nAutoGen (Wu et al., 2023), and MetaGPT (Hong et al.,\\n2023), while delivering specialized capacity, often heav-\\nily rely on manual configurations, including prompt engi-\\nneering, agent profiling, and inter-agent communication\\npipelines (Qian et al., 2024). This dependency significantly\\nlimits the rapid adaptation of multi-agent systems to di-\\nverse domains and application scenarios (Tang et al., 2023;\\nZhang et al., 2024c). More recently, the research com-\\nmunity has shifted toward automating multi-agent system\\ndesign. For instance, DsPy (Khattab et al., 2023) and Evo-\\nPrompting (Guo et al., 2023) automate prompt optimization,\\nGPTSwarm (Zhuge et al., 2024) and G-Designer (Zhang\\net al., 2024b) optimize inter-agent communication, and\\nEvoAgent (Yuan et al., 2024) and AutoAgents (Chen et al.,\\n2023a) self-evolve agent profiling.
