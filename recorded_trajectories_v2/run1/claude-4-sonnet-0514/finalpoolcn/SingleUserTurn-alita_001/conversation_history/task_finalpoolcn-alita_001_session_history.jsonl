These\\\\ncapabilities have enabled a wide range of applications, ranging from travel planning [ 3 ], computer use [ 4, 5, 6 ],\\\\nto the multi-step research tasks [ 7 ]. To support such diverse and demanding tasks, a new class of systems called\\\\ngeneralist agents has emerged. These agents are designed to handle a wide range of domains and tasks through a unified\\\\narchitecture, allowing them to generalize beyond task-specific solutions, such as OpenAI Deep Research [ 1 ] and Manus.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, most of the current general-purpose agents heavily rely on large-scale manual engineering, including tediously\\\\ndesigned workflows, considerable pre-defined tools, and hardcoded components [ 8, 9 ]. This reliance introduces several\\\\ncritical limitations: i) It is impractical, if not impossible, to predefine all the tools required for the wide variety of\\\\nreal-world tasks an agent might encounter ( *imcomplete coverage* ); ii) Many complex tasks require agents to creatively\\\\ncompose new tools or leverage existing ones in novel ways while pre-designed workflow and hardcoded components\\\\nconstrain this compositional flexibility and inhibit the development of adaptive behaviors ( *limited creativity and*\\\\n*flexibility* ); iii) It is not always the case that the interface or environment of different tools are compatible with the agent\\\\n( *mismatch* ). For example, many useful tools are not written in Python, which makes it difficult, though not entirely\\\\nimpossible, for them to be pre-connected to the mainstream agent frameworks that are primarily written in Python.\\\\nTogether, these challenges ultimately hinder the scalability, adaptability, and generalization of existing generalist agents.\\\\n\\\\nIn contrast to the prevailing trend of growing complexity, we propose a radically simple design philosophy built on two\\\\nprinciples: i) *Minimal Predefinition* : Equip the agent with only a minimal set of core capabilities, avoiding manually\\\\nengineered components for specific tasks or modalities; ii) *Maximal Self-Evolution* : Empower the agent to autonomously\\\\ncreate, refine, and reuse external capabilities as needed. We instantiate this vision through Alita, a generalist agent built\\\\nwith a single core capability (i.e., the web agent) and a small set of general-purpose modules that enable self-directed\\\\ncapability expansion. Specifically, we take advantage of the Model Context Protocols (MCPs) [1] which is an open\\\\nprotocol that standardizes how different systems provide context to LLMs, and empower Alita to dynamically generate,\\\\nadapt, and reuse MCPs based on the demands of each task rather than relying on static, predefined tools. This shift from\\\\nmanually designed capabilities to on-the-fly MCP construction unlocks a new path for building agents that are simple\\\\nyet profoundly capable.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n|Col1|Col2|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n||MCP Creation|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n|Col1|Col2|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Self Evolving||\\\\n|||\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: Comparison between Traditional Generalist Agents and Alita. Traditional generalist agents heavily rely on\\\\nlarge-scale manual engineering while Alita adheres to minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution.\\\\n\\\\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks to assess Alita in real-world applications, especially\\\\non the most popular GAIA [ 10 ]. Alita proves that simplicity is not a constraint, but a strength, and that creative agent\\\\nbehavior can emerge from a design that prioritizes autonomy over manual engineering. To sum up, our key contributions\\\\ncan be summarized as follows.\\\\n\\\\n    - We propose a new agent architecture centered on minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution, challenging\\\\nconventional design norms in generalist agents, aiming to call for a more scalable and generalizable agent\\\\nframework.\\\\n\\\\n1 `https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol`\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n    - We present Alita, a generalist agent that achieves scalable agentic reasoning with a radically simple design.\\\\n\\\\n    - We empirically demonstrate that Alita, despite using no complex predefined tools and workflows for specific\\\\ntasks, outperforms many systems with significantly more handcrafted complexity on the GAIA benchmark.\\\\nWe achieve 75.15% pass@1 and 87.27% pass@3, surpassing OpenAI\\\\u2019s Deep Research with 67.36% pass@1\\\\nand ranking top among all general-purpose agents.\\\\n\\\\n**2** **Related Works**\\\\n\\\\n**2.1** **Generalist Agent**\\\\n\\\\nThe concept of a Generalist Agent aims to construct an AI agent system capable of collaboratively completing a variety\\\\nof complex tasks in a real-world environment. OWL [ 8 ] introduces a method that decomposes complex tasks into\\\\nsubtasks and dynamically allocates them to worker nodes with specialized toolkits. Omne [ 11 ] proposes a multiagent collaborative development framework, where each agent possesses an independent system structure, enabling\\\\nautonomous learning and the storage of a comprehensive world model to build an independent understanding of the\\\\nenvironment. OpenAI Deep Research [2] employs reinforcement learning for training on real-world tasks, aiming to\\\\nprovide precise and reliable research reports for knowledge-intensive tasks. A-World [ 12 ] offers a highly configurable,\\\\nmodular, and scalable simulation environment, allowing developers to flexibly define and integrate different types of AI\\\\nagents. The Magentic-One [ 13 ] framework merges the Magentic and Autogen systems, distinguishing between the\\\\nmicro-level LLM-driven function generation and the macro-level multi-agent orchestration, resulting in a clearer and\\\\nmore efficient construction of agent systems. Alita, also a Generalist Agent, allows for the minimal use of predefined\\\\ntools and workflows for direct problem-solving, yet still achieves impressive performance across diverse tasks.\\\\n\\\\n**2.2** **Auto Generating Agent**\\\\n\\\\nAuto-generating agents aim to enhance the versatility of agents by enabling them to autonomously generate tools,\\\\nagents, or workflows tailored to specific tasks. AutoAgents [ 14 ], for instance, generate multiple agents, each playing a\\\\ndistinct role, to handle the corresponding subtasks. OpenHands [ 15 ] offers an event-driven architecture that allows\\\\nagents to interact with the environment like human developers, thereby enabling the creation of custom workflows.\\\\nAFlow [ 16 ] redefines workflow optimization as a search problem, where each workflow consists of several nodes\\\\ninvoking large LLMs, and the optimal workflow is identified and executed through a search process. AutoAgent [ 17 ], as\\\\nan autonomous agent operating system, permits agents to manage system-level operations and file data autonomously.\\\\nIn Alita, agents are empowered to automatically generate diverse, specialized, and highly accurate MCPs to aid in the\\\\ncompletion of specific tasks, while also providing resources for future executions.\\\\n\\\\n**2.3** **Tool Creation**\\\\n\\\\nTool Creation enables agents to autonomously create tools to assist in task execution, either on their own or with external\\\\nsupport. CRAFT [ 18 ] utilizes GPT-4 to generate a set of code snippets that function as tools, which are then retrieved\\\\nand used in the system. TroVE [19] maintains a collection of high-level functions, which are automatically generated,\\\\nextended, and periodically pruned to optimize program generation. CREATOR [ 20 ] decouples the abstraction of tool\\\\ncreation from the actual execution, allowing LLMs to address tasks at different levels of granularity. AutoAgent [ 17 ]\\\\nenables agents to autonomously create new tools based on task requirements, incorporating information gathered\\\\nthrough web searches and integrating these tools into their workflow. OpenHands [ 15 ] allows agents to create code\\\\nscripts in a human-like manner during interaction with the environment to assist in task completion. In comparison,\\\\nAlita enables MCP creation, which provides additional benefits, including better reusability and easy environment\\\\nmanagement over tool creation.\\\\n\\\\n**2.4** **MCP**\\\\n\\\\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard proposed by Anthropic, designed to unify the connection between AI\\\\nsystems and external data sources and services. RAG-MCP [ 21 ] enhances the efficiency and accuracy of agents by\\\\nretrieving the most relevant tools from a large collection, based on the task description, within the database composed\\\\nof MCP descriptions. After tool generation, Alita wraps the generated valid tools into MCPs for subsequent use,\\\\nfacilitating reuse by itself and other agents.\\\\n\\\\n2 https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\n**3** **Methods**\\\\n\\\\nWe propose Alita, a generalist agent enabling scalable agentic reasoning with minimal predefinition and maximal\\\\nself-evolution to tackle diverse and complex tasks. Figure **3** illustrates the framework of Alita. In contrast to generalist\\\\nagents that typically depend on extensive manually-designed tools and workflows [ 8, 9 ], the manager agent in Alita\\\\nsolely orchestrates the web agent using only basic tools. Through this approach, our framework enables Alita to plan\\\\ntask-specific tools through brainstorming. It then utilizes a Web Agent to search for helpful open-source libraries\\\\nand other resources related to these tools. Leveraging the search results, Alita autonomously generates new tools and\\\\nconfigures the necessary environments to enhance its capabilities and effectively solve tasks. During this process, if\\\\nany issues arise with the newly generated tools or their environments, Alita can provide feedback and self-correct,\\\\nimproving the quality of the generated tools. Furthermore, the new tools can be encapsulated as MCP servers for future\\\\nreuse. With the aid of MCPs, Alita can generate increasingly powerful, diverse, and complex MCPs, thus establishing a\\\\nself-reinforcing cycle. Therefore, Alita autonomously expands its capabilities through continuous MCP integration.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: The architecture of Alita. Upon receiving a question, the Manager Agent initiates an iterative CodeReAct\\\\nloop to analyze tasks, identify functional gaps, and trigger MCP Brainstorming for creative synthesis. The system\\\\ndynamically performs open-source searching, script generation, and virtual environment execution to construct taskrelated functions. Useful ones are encapsulated into reusable MCPs and stored in the MCP Box. Throughout this\\\\nprocess, the Manager Agent collaborates with the Web Agent for external information retrieval and continuously\\\\nintegrates intermediate results until a final output is produced. This process enables Alita to self-evolve without relying\\\\non a huge hand-crafted, elaborate tools and workflows.\\\\n\\\\n**3.1** **Execution Pipeline**\\\\n\\\\nEach task commences with the construction of an augmented prompt that incorporates the original query. The manager\\\\nagent (Sec. 3.2) then initiates a multi-step reasoning process to address the task at hand. Throughout this process, the\\\\nagent may query external sources via the web agent (Sec. 3.3), plan and synthesize new tools (Sec. 3.4), and execute\\\\nthem within isolated environments (Sec. 3.4.4).\\\\n\\\\nUpon successful tool generation and accurate result formulation, the corresponding script is transformed into an MCP\\\\nand stored in the internal tool registry for future reuse. All reasoning steps, intermediate code, and final outputs are\\\\nsystematically logged to facilitate comprehensive analysis.\\\\n\\\\n**3.2** **Manager Agent**\\\\n\\\\nThe Manager Agent functions as the central coordinator within framework of Alita. When receiving a task prompt, the\\\\nmanager agent initially calls the `MCP Brainstorming` to determine whether additional tools are needed and which\\\\nspecific tools are required. Then the manager agent decomposes the task into subtasks and dispatches them to web\\\\nagent or generates the required external tools to complete the subtask. When necessary, the manager agent utilizes the\\\\ninformation retrieved by the web agent to generate the required new tools along with their corresponding environment\\\\nconfiguration instructions. After collecting all intermediate results, the manager performs final aggregation and response\\\\nformulation.\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\n**Tool Usage** . In contrast to traditional systems that rely on extensive predefined toolkits, the manager agent embraces Alita\\\\u2019s minimal philosophy by employing concise but powerful toolkits, including `MCP Brainstorming`,\\\\n`ScriptGeneratingTool` and `CodeRunningTool` . Specifically, `MCP Brainstorming` detects functional gaps, identifies necessary supplementary tools and outlines tool specifications; `ScriptGeneratingTool` obtains tool specification\\\\noutlines and then generates appropriate tools tailored to the task requirements; `CodeRunningTool` executes generated\\\\ncode in isolated environments and caches the output for potential MCP servers generation. These tools are intelligently\\\\ninvoked in response to the task\\\\u2019s evolving demands, ensuring adaptive and efficient problem-solving.\\\\n\\\\n**3.3** **Web Agent**\\\\n\\\\nThe web agent retrieves relevant information from external sources when internal knowledge is insufficient. It is\\\\nparticularly effective for tasks requiring the retrieval of domain-specific code or documentation. With a lightweight,\\\\ntext-based web interface and modular navigation tools, the web agent traverses multiple websites, extract relevant\\\\nsegments, and return reasonable URLs or raw content.\\\\n\\\\n**Tool Usage** . The agent utilizes `SimpleTextBrowser` as its web interface and page-level control tools: `VisitTool`,\\\\n`PageUpTool`, and `PageDownTool` to navigate webpages. For query-based lookups, it applies `GoogleSearchTool` for\\\\nopen web search and `GithubSearchTool` to identify reusable open-source tools. This design supports real-time code\\\\nretrieval and context-aware tool planning.\\\\n\\\\n**3.4** **MCP Creation Component**\\\\n\\\\nTo enable the creativity of the agent, we design three tools collaboratively contributing to the MCP creation process.\\\\n\\\\n**3.4.1** **MCP Brainstorming**\\\\n\\\\nSince LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their capabilities [ 22 ], we introduce `MCP Brainstorming` to conduct\\\\npreliminary capability assessment by providing both the task and the description of current framework. We designed specialized prompts to facilitate accurate self-assessment of the agent\\\\u2019s capabilities. Moreover, when `MCP Brainstorming`\\\\nidentifies insufficient capabilities of the framework to complete the task, it provides references for tool generation to\\\\nbridge the capability gap. This provides prior guidance for subsequent tool selection and task planning required to\\\\naccomplish given objectives.\\\\n\\\\n**3.4.2** **ScriptGeneratingTool**\\\\n\\\\nThe `ScriptGeneratingTool` is a code-building utility designed for constructing external tools. It receives explicit\\\\nsubtask descriptions and suggestions for code construction from the manager agent, and potentially useful GitHub links\\\\nobtained via the web agent, which can provide information such as `README.md` files or code snippets from GitHub to\\\\nguide the script generation process. Furthermore, `ScriptGeneratingTool` generates the environment script to create\\\\nthe required environment for the code running and the cleaning script to clean up redundant files and environments\\\\ngenerated after script execution. Therefore, `ScriptGeneratingTool` ensures that the generated scripts are valid,\\\\nself-contained, and executable, making them suitable for deployment in the given task, and reusable in the future.\\\\n\\\\n**3.4.3** **CodeRunningTool**\\\\n\\\\nThe `CodeRunningTool` validates the functionality of the generated script by executing it within an isolated environment.\\\\nIf the execution produces the expected results, the tool is registered in the system as a reusable MCP. This process also\\\\nsupports iterative refinement, allowing for error inspection and subsequent code regeneration to improve the script\\\\u2019s\\\\nperformance.\\\\n\\\\n**3.4.4** **Environment Management**\\\\n\\\\nUpon retrieving or generating a candidate tool, the system activates the environment planner module. This module\\\\nparses the relevant repository or script metadata such as `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, and shell scripts using\\\\nthe `TextInspectorTool` . It extracts and validates the dependencies and setup instructions to construct an isolated\\\\nexecution profile. Subsequently, a new Conda environment is created with a unique name (typically derived from the\\\\ntask ID or a hash of the repository path), and dependencies are installed using `conda install` or `pip install` .\\\\n\\\\nAll runtime environments are initialized locally in parallel, obviating the need for administrative privileges or containerization technologies. This approach ensures high compatibility across various tasks while preserving the portability\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nof the system. During execution, the environment is explicitly activated prior to invoking the code interpreter, thus\\\\nensuring both isolation and reproducibility.\\\\n\\\\nIn the event of a failure during environment initialization\\\\u2014due to issues such as missing packages, syntax errors in setup\\\\nscripts, or unavailable dependencies\\\\u2014Alita activates an automated recovery procedure. This procedure attempts various\\\\nfallback strategies, including relaxing version constraints or identifying the minimal set of dependencies required for\\\\nfunctionality. If these recovery attempts are unsuccessful, the tool is discarded, and the failure is logged for offline\\\\nanalysis and future investigation. This enables Alita to self-correct its designed tools, thereby generating more accurate\\\\nand robust solutions.\\\\n\\\\n**4** **Experiments**\\\\n\\\\n**4.1** **Experiment Setting**\\\\n\\\\n**4.1.1** **Benchmarks**\\\\n\\\\nTo evaluate the general task-handling capabilities of Alita, we conducted extensive testing across multiple agent\\\\nbenchmarks.\\\\n\\\\n**GAIA [** **10** **]:** GAIA is a benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of general-purpose AI assistants. It consists of\\\\n466 real-world scenario-based questions covering daily tasks, scientific reasoning, web browsing, and tool usage.

Alita\\\\u2019s development is largely\\\\nbased on the framework of Open Deep Research-smolagents. However, we remove many pre-defined tools and also add\\\\nthe MCP creation component to follow the design principle of minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution.\\\\n\\\\n**AutoAgent [** **17** **]:** AutoAgent is a zero-code platform designed to facilitate the creation, customization, and deployment\\\\nof agents powered by LLMs. By providing a natural language interface, it allows users to develop multi-agent systems,\\\\ndesign workflows, and integrate tools without requiring technical expertise.\\\\n\\\\n**OWL [** **8** **]:** OWL is an open-source, multi-agent framework built on the CAMEL-AI platform, designed to support the\\\\nautomation of complex real-world tasks through dynamic agent collaboration.

The table presents the accuracy at different levels of difficulty for GAIA, as well as\\\\nthe overall performance on Mathvista and PathVQA. The pass@1, pass@2, and pass@3 denote the accuracy achieved\\\\nby running the Alita framework 1, 2, and 3 times, respectively, and selecting the best answer. Alita outperforms all\\\\nbaseline agents across the GAIA levels, achieving the highest total accuracy.\\\\n\\\\n**5** **Analysis**\\\\n\\\\n**5.1** **Reuse of Alita-Generated MCPs**\\\\n\\\\n**5.1.1** **Overview**\\\\n\\\\nWe collect the MCPs generated from running the GAIA dataset using Alita in conjunction with powerful models\\\\n(Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o). The benefits of reusing Alita-generated MCPs are **two-fold** . First, these MCPs can be\\\\nreused by other agent frameworks and improve their performance since Alita, instead of human developers, designs a\\\\nset of useful MCPs fit to GAIA by trial and error. Second, these MCPs can be reused by agents with smaller LLMs\\\\nand **significantly** improve the performance. The reuse of auto-generated MCPs for agents with smaller LLMs can be\\\\nviewed as a new way of distillation from larger LLMs. Traditionally, distillation might be fine-tuning smaller LLMs on\\\\ndata generated by larger LLMs. In comparison, the reuse of MCPs generated from agents with larger LLMs is much\\\\neasier, cheaper, and faster than traditional distillation.\\\\n\\\\n7\\\\n\\\\n**5.1.2** **Reuse by Open Deep Research-smolagents**\\\\n\\\\nWe run open Deep Research-smolagents [ 25 ] on GAIA with and without Alita-generated MCPs based on GPT-4o. The\\\\nresults are presented in Table 2. From this experiment, we observe that the reuse of Alita-generated MCPs results in\\\\nbetter performance compared to the base framework for all difficulty levels. This demonstrates that Alita can generate\\\\nvery useful MCPs, which can be provided to other agents, helping them enhance their capabilities and solve problems\\\\nthat would otherwise be unsolvable. Additionally, the consistent improvement across all difficulty levels indicates that\\\\nAlita\\\\u2019s MCPs provide generalizable utility rather than just addressing specific edge cases in the dataset.\\\\n\\\\n**Model Configuration** **Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3** **Total**\\\\n\\\\nODR-smolagents + GPT-4o(No Alita MCPs) 33.96% 29.07% 11.54% 27.88%\\\\n\\\\nODR-smolagents + GPT-4o(With Alita MCPs) 39.62% 36.05% 15.38% **33.94%**\\\\n\\\\nTable 2: Comparison of performance between ODR-smolagents with and without Alita-generated MCPs. The results\\\\nare reported at different GAIA levels: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and the average. Each column corresponds to the\\\\nperformance at the respective GAIA levels. The reuse of Alita-generated MCPs can enhance the performance of other\\\\nagents.\\\\n\\\\n**5.1.3** **Reuse by Base Agent on Smaller LLM**\\\\n\\\\nWe reuse MCPs in the base framework, i.e., ODR-smolagents [ 25 ], without the MCP creation component in Alita, and\\\\nalso with some extra pre-defined tools used in ODR-smolagents based on GPT-4o-mini. The results are presented in\\\\nTable 3.\\\\n\\\\n**Model Configuration** **Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3** **Average**\\\\n\\\\nBase Framework + GPT-4o-mini (No Alita MCP) 32.08% 20.93% 3.85% 21.82%\\\\n\\\\nBase Framework + GPT-4o-mini (With Alita MCP) 39.62% 27.91% 11.54% **29.09%**\\\\n\\\\nTable 3: Comparison of performance between the base framework on GPT-4o-mini, with and without Alita-generated\\\\nMCPs. The results are reported at different GAIA levels: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and the average. Each column\\\\ncorresponds to the performance at the respective GAIA levels. The reuse of Alita-generated MCPs significantly\\\\nenhances the performance of agents on smaller LLMs.\\\\n\\\\nFrom this experiment, we observe that the reuse of Alita-generated MCPs significantly improves performance over the\\\\nbase framework based on a smaller LLM. This is because the Alita-generated MCPs can be considered MCPs distilled\\\\nfrom powerful models (Claude-3.7-Sonnet), which are made available for agents on smaller LLMs. This helps bridge\\\\nthe gap between the agents on smaller LLMs and agents on larger LLMs in certain domains, thereby enhancing its\\\\ntask-processing capabilities. Especially for Level 3, we observe a particularly dramatic improvement with the accuracy\\\\ntripling from **3.85** % to **11.54** %. This substantial improvement on the most challenging problems demonstrates that\\\\nAlita-generated MCPs are especially valuable for complex reasoning tasks where agents on smaller LLMs typically\\\\nstruggle the most. The MCPs effectively encapsulate sophisticated problem-solving capabilities that the smaller model\\\\ncan leverage without needing to develop the full reasoning chain independently.\\\\n\\\\n**5.2** **Alita on Smaller LLM**\\\\n\\\\nWe hypothesize that **Alita will be even stronger with the increasing coding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in**\\\\n**the future** . To validate our performance, we run Alita on GAIA using GPT-4o-mini instead of Claude-3.7-Sonnet. The\\\\nresults can be found in Table 4. Different to the experiment in Section 5.1.3, the agent doesn\\\\u2019t have distilled MCPs - the\\\\nagent on GPT-4o-mini model must generate its own MCPs. The results are presented in Table 4.\\\\n\\\\nFrom this experiment, on one hand, we observe that Alita, after replacing the models with GPT-4o-mini, performs\\\\nsignificantly worse on GAIA. This substantial performance gap highlights the critical role of the underlying models\\\\u2019\\\\ncoding capabilities. On the other hand, the performance of Alita increases rapidly as the capabilities of the underlying\\\\nmodels improve. We can expect that with future updates to the LLMs, Alita\\\\u2019s performance will continue to strengthen,\\\\nsurpassing its current capabilities. The design of future generalist agents might be much simpler in the future, without\\\\nany predefined tools and workflows for direct problem-solving. Instead, human developers might focus on designing\\\\nmodules for enabling and stimulating the creativity and evolution of generalist agents.\\\\n\\\\n8\\\\n\\\\n**Model Configuration** **Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3** **Total**\\\\n\\\\nAlita (Claude-3.7-Sonnet, GPT-4o) 81.13% 75.58% 46.15% **72.73%**\\\\n\\\\nAlita (GPT-4o-mini) 54.72% 44.19% 19.23% 43.64%\\\\n\\\\nTable 4: Comparison of performance between Alita(Claude-3.7-Sonnet,GPT-4o) and Alita(GPT-4o-mini). The results\\\\nare reported at different GAIA levels: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and the average. Each column corresponds to the\\\\nperformance at the respective GAIA levels. The integration of a smaller model significantly reduces the performance.\\\\n\\\\n**5.3** **Case Study**\\\\n\\\\nTo investigate Alita\\\\u2019s workflow when tackling tasks, we conducted a case study on its approach to solving a Level 3\\\\ndifficult problem in GAIA. The details of this process are presented in Appendix A. From the case study, we observe\\\\nthat Alita is able to perform a structured MCP brainstorming session based on the task at hand, effectively identifying\\\\nand utilizing relevant resources to implement a feasible MCP that aids in completing the task.\\\\n\\\\n**6** **Conclusion**\\\\n\\\\nIn this work, we introduced **Alita**, a generalist agent designed with the principles of minimal predefinition and maximal\\\\nself-evolution. By significantly reducing reliance on manually predefined tools and workflows for direct solving,\\\\nAlita leverages creative, autonomous capabilities in real time, facilitating scalable agentic reasoning. Our approach\\\\ndemonstrates that simplicity in design does not undermine, but rather enhances, the performance and adaptability of\\\\ngeneralist agents.\\\\n\\\\n9\\\\n\\\\n**References**\\\\n\\\\n[1] OpenAI.

Our household survey shows that there\\\\nis substantial variation in power structure across regions.

Our primary objective was to learn the socio-economic-political profile of the elite\\\\nhouseholds and their involvement in village life. This paper provides\\\\na summary of our findings. We observe that landlordism has considerably weakened, land has ceased to be the sole source of power and new\\\\npower-centres have emerged. Despite these changes, caste, landownership and patron-client relation continue to be three important pillars\\\\nof rural power structure.\\\\n\\\\n**JEL Classification:** O12, P16.\\\\n\\\\n**Keywords and Phrases:** Clientelism, Lanlordism, Network\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n### **1 Introduction**\\\\n\\\\nThe motivation behind this work has two intertwined components: first, introducing a new methodology for identifying \\\\u2018power-centres\\\\u2019 in rural societies\\\\nof developing countries *in general* [1] and then applying that in the *specific* context of contemporary rural India for addressing some debates on the dynamics\\\\nof power in rural India.\\\\nThere is a relatively recent surge of research in understanding clientelistic\\\\nrural institutions: especially in the context of *political* clientelism. Bardhan\\\\nand Mookherjee (2017) and Ravanilla et al. (2017) provide recent surveys\\\\nof this strand of research. A particular theme of such research consists of\\\\nidentifying the position of political elites in some relevant social networks and\\\\nthen measuring the outcomes of having such a position (the study by Cruz\\\\net al., 2017 on Philippines is a notable example). However, in such studies,\\\\nthe clientelism-provider\\\\u2013the \\\\u2018elites\\\\u2019\\\\u2013are identified a priori. We, in contrast,\\\\ntake the network of socio-economic interactions (within and surrounding a\\\\nvillage) as the *primitive* and then identify elites on the very basis of such\\\\nnetwork data (our methodology is described and its significance discussed in\\\\ndetail in Section 2 below).\\\\nWe apply this methodology to investigate a set of contentious issues in the\\\\npolitical economy of rural India. Economic Survey of India (2017) estimates\\\\nthat about 377 million people from India\\\\u2019s total population of 1.21 billion are\\\\ncity-dwellers. If urban-like features, high population density in a contiguous\\\\narea and high density of build-up area, are used then the estimate is even\\\\nhigher. According to World Bank\\\\u2019s agglomeration index, 55.3% of India\\\\u2019s\\\\npopulation already live in areas which have urban-like features. Moreover,\\\\nabout 10 million people, as per Economic Survey of India (2017), migrate to\\\\ncities and towns every year. There is a common perception among policymakers and academics alike that India is about to become, if not already is,\\\\na predominantly urbanized nation. Naturally, such features have given rise\\\\nto the question of the nature of concomitant transformation of rural India.\\\\nGupta (2005) asserts that \\\\u201cthe village in India, where life was once portrayed as \\\\u2018unchanging\\\\u2019 and \\\\u2018idyllic\\\\u2019, has in recent decades seen profound\\\\nchanges. The twin shackles that once decided matters for India\\\\u2019s villagers,\\\\ncaste and agriculture, no longer exercise their vigorous hold.\\\\u201d What are the\\\\n\\\\n1 This work is one of the outputs of a research programme undertaken mainly by three\\\\nof the authors, some other related outputs being Bhattacharya, Kar and Nandi (2017,\\\\n2018).\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\nchannels of such transformation? Existing literature on this can be classified\\\\ninto three broad (but indeed interconnected) categories - economic changes,\\\\nsocial changes and political changes. On the economic front two distinct\\\\nchannels have received particular attention - agrarian stagnation and gradual\\\\nurbanization. So far as landholding is concerned, big landlord estates have\\\\nmostly disappeared, average size of landholding has declined by 60 per cent\\\\nin the last 50 years. The rural landscape now is believed to be characterized\\\\nby cultivator-owners and landless labourers. In the meantime, profitability\\\\nof farms, once boosted by technological changes during the \\\\u2018green revolution\\\\u2019, has diminished to such an extent that by one estimate only families\\\\nwhose landholding are above four times of national average are able to earn\\\\na positive profit from cultivation (Basole and Basu, 2011)). Thus, agricultural employment both in the forms of casual labour and tenancy, once the\\\\nmost important sources of income for landless households, has become secondary to rural non-farm activities (like small business or self-employment)\\\\nand urban casual employments. A CSDS study (2013) on the state of farmers\\\\nrevealed that 75 percent of farmers, particularly the younger generation, want\\\\nto give up farming. Agricultural stagnation, along with a shift towards urban\\\\nemployment is understood to have triggered deep socio-political changes in\\\\nrural areas. Earlier, landless households, particularly dalit and some OBC\\\\n(other backward classes) castes, were tied to and dependent on the landed\\\\nfamilies for employment and credit. This was the main source of political\\\\npower and social dominance of the landed castes. As agricultural stagnation pushed labouring castes outside the villages and out of agriculture, they\\\\nhave ceased to be dependent on the upper castes. Hence it is conjectured that\\\\nthe power of landlords as patron and political leaders has also diminished.\\\\nGupta (2005) claims that \\\\u201ccaste as a system is dying\\\\u201d in rural India. Decline in power based on land and caste appears to have opened the door for a\\\\nnew type of political leaders. Krishna (2003) records that these \\\\u2018naya netas\\\\u2019\\\\n(new leaders) lack inherited clientelistic networks. Instead. this is a group\\\\nof educated youngsters whose main skill is the capacity to mediate between\\\\nthe administration and villagers. Jodhka (2014) asserts that one can observe\\\\nthe process of \\\\u2018dissociation, distancing and autonomy\\\\u2019 in the emerging rural\\\\nsociety: that is, clientelistic links based on an agricultural economy are disintegrating. Contest for power seems to have become more competitive and\\\\nis being shaped by \\\\u2018macro\\\\u2019 factors rather than local constraints.\\\\nAlthough several recent academic studies revolve around the above narrative, a debate has got stimulated too. Pattenden (2011) argues that although\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\ntraditional route to power has weakened, more subtle kinds of political control by the upper castes persists. Ramachandran et. al. (2010) find persistence of landed power and wealth in their study. Harriss (2013) cautions\\\\nthat \\\\u201cthe idea that land is no longer so important as the basis of status and\\\\npower should certainly not be overestimated.\\\\u201d Ananthpur et al. (2014) observe that traditionally dominant households, even without formal positions\\\\nin political office, can still influence decisions of local governments. Anderson et al. (2015 a,b) also document the presence and impact of clientelistic\\\\npower relatiosn in the agrarian economy (of Maharashtra) through control\\\\nover economic resources.\\\\n\\\\nIn this backdrop, our study aims to address systematically the following\\\\nquestions in the context of India. Has clientelistic power relations, embedded in an agrarian economy, lost its prominence in rural India or does it\\\\nstill survive in a more subtle and diversified form? Are there \\\\u2018local\\\\u2019 powerful\\\\nelements who control patronage networks? If so, are they mainly the erstwhile landlords or are they predominantly new entrants? What is the source\\\\nof their power: is it mainly their ability to mediate between administration\\\\nand villagers or is it their control over important economic resources? Our\\\\napproach in addressing these questions brings together aspects of qualitative village studies and quantitative economic modelling. We believe that\\\\ninstitution is not *merely an economic* category - it is an aggregate of social\\\\nrelations that operate within political-economic spheres. Hence nature of\\\\nrural institutions cannot be identified by merely looking at economic indicators (as attempted in, for example, Basole and Basu, 2011). We consider it\\\\nto be more illuminating to measure the nature of institutions from data on\\\\nthe personalized day-to-day interactions of agents in the spheres of economy,\\\\nsociety and politics. We do so on the bases of primary data collected by\\\\nourselves in 36 villages from three states in India (details below).\\\\nIn the next section we describe our methodology and data. Section 3\\\\ndiscusses the results of our analyses. Some concluding comments are given\\\\nin Section 4. The relevant tables and diagrams are collected at the end. At\\\\nthe very end, in an appendix we describe our sampling methodology in detail.\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\n### **2 Methodology and Data**\\\\n#### **2.1 The conceptual framework**\\\\n\\\\nWe primarily conceptualize institution as the structure of multidimensional\\\\ndependence in the spheres of economy, society and politics. For investigating\\\\nthe nature of rural power relations (and clientelism in particular), we seek\\\\nto explore whether such dependence is concentrated on a few entities dominating over a good many of the households or whether this is distributed\\\\nin a sufficiently diffuse manner. Moreover, our emphasis is on such dependence at *local* level, roughly at the level of a village and the neighbouring\\\\nvillages and town(s). Meiksins Wood (2003) emphasizes this aspect while\\\\ndistinguishing between institutions. She observes \\\\u201c...only capitalism has a\\\\ndistinct economic sphere. This is so both because economic power is separate\\\\nfrom political or military force and because it is only in capitalism that the\\\\nmarket has a force of its own, which imposes on everyone, capitalists as well\\\\nas workers, certain impersonal systemic requirements of competition, accumulation and profit-maximization...Although the sovereign territorial state\\\\nwas not created by capitalism, the distinctively capitalist separation of the\\\\neconomic and the political has produced a more clearly defined and complete\\\\nterritorial sovereignty than was possible in non-capitalist societies. At the\\\\nsame time, many social functions that once fell within the scope of state administration or communal regulation now belong to the economy\\\\u201d. While we\\\\ndo not seek to label institutions as \\\\u2018capitalist\\\\u2019 or \\\\u2018semi-feudal\\\\u2019 etc, we use the\\\\npattern of dependence as an identifier of changing institutional dynamics.\\\\nThe basis for constructing our institutional variation is the multidimensional directed network where the primary nodes are the sampled households\\\\n\\\\n.\\\\n(HH hereafter) in villages [2] We collected data from 36 villages (selected\\\\nthrough stratified and then PPS sampling) in three states of India (12 villages\\\\nfrom each of Maharashtra, Odisha and the (eastern half) of Uttar Pradesh\\\\n(UP)) using personal interviews at the HH level [3] . While we provide the details of our sample design in an appendix at the end, here we still make a\\\\nfew remarks about the representativeness of our sample. First, one of the\\\\nstates, Maharashtra, happens to be among the richest states in India (con\\\\n2 This section draws heavily from Bhattacharya, Kar and Nandi (2017) a companion\\\\npaper of ours.\\\\n3 A part of the HH survey, covering mainly Odisha and Maharashtra, took place during\\\\nMarch-April, 2013 and much of the survey in UP took place in November-December, 2013.\\\\n\\\\n6\\\\n\\\\ntaining the city of Mumbai, the commercial capital of India) whereas the\\\\nstate of Odisha is considered to be a poor one: with histories of famine and\\\\nstarvation-deaths in some of its rural parts. Next, given the well-known evidence of \\\\u2018persistence\\\\u2019 of land-revenue-related institutions from the British\\\\ncolonial period in rural India (e.g., Banerjee and Iyer, 2005), we took care so\\\\nthat our sample villages contain diverse histories of such land-revenue-related\\\\ninstitutions: *ryotwari* (direct payment by the farmers to governmental taxcollectors) to *zamindari* (landlord-based system) as well as erstwhile princely\\\\nstates. Further, since the structure of rural economy in interior areas (which\\\\nis expected to be predominantly agricultural) is quite different from that in\\\\ncoastal villages (where fishing and related activities generate a good deal of\\\\ndiversity of occupational structure), we included both coastal and interior\\\\nvillages in our sample. Therefore, while our sample size for villages is not\\\\nmuch large, these are sufficiently representative for a large part of India.\\\\nSince we wanted to capture the network of interactions in each village\\\\nsampled, we adopted the following scheme: if a sample village contained\\\\nupto 100 HHs, then all the HHs in that village were surveyed; and with sample villages with more than 100 HHs, approximately 100 randomly selected\\\\nHHs were surveyed. In the HH-survey we gathered information, among other\\\\naspects, on links the sample households have for help in spheres of day-to-day\\\\neconomic interactions (like whom the HH depends on primarily for getting\\\\nproductive inputs, for selling of outputs if any, for loans etc), social interactions (like whom the HH approaches for advices on family matters and\\\\ndisputes, religious matters etc) as well as political ones (like whom the HH\\\\naccompanies to political events if any etc). In Table1a we give the detailed list\\\\nof the items of such help. We aggregate this information on multidimensional\\\\nlinkages of HHs on other HHs or entities to derive an unidimensional *depen-*\\\\n*dence* network in each village (the details of which are given in the following\\\\nsub-section). The main underlying principle for constructing these dependence networks is that a HH A is \\\\u2018dependent\\\\u2019 on a HH B, when it receives\\\\ncertain economic/social/political input from another HH B and the converse\\\\nis not true. An entity with sufficiently many such dependents is called a local\\\\n*elite* . A village having at least one local elite is called an *elite village* [4] . Recall\\\\nfrom Section 1 that most of the studies which try to identify power centres,\\\\n\\\\n4 In Bhattacharya, Kar and Nandi (2017) we also assigned a score of \\\\u2018elitism\\\\u2019, called\\\\n*Nclscore,* to each village which measures the *intensity* of clientelistic institutions prevailing\\\\nin that village. But we refrain from a description of that here as that is not strictly relevant\\\\nfor the present exercise.\\\\n\\\\n7\\\\n\\\\neither rely on *direct queries about important entities*, which is vulnerable to\\\\nmisreporting and under-reporting, or are based on the researchers\\\\u2019 subjective impressions. We emphasize that in contrast, we systematically derive\\\\nthe set of \\\\u2018important\\\\u2019 entities from the revealed behaviour of the respondents\\\\nthemselves in several spheres of their actual lived experiences.\\\\nOne noticeable feature of what we call an elite village is that such a\\\\nvillage consists of a small number of persons/households (in our data we find\\\\nthem to be usually less than four or five) who have control over a number of\\\\nhouseholds in terms of crucial economic dimensions (like providing credit or\\\\nemployment) and very often these same persons dominate in the spheres of\\\\nsocial interactions as well as in political arenas around the village. In many\\\\ncases the village *sarpanch/pradhan* (head) happens to be *one* such person [5] .\\\\nHowever, as we note in detail in the following section, not all elites have\\\\nconnections with formal political power.\\\\nNote that local elites were identified on the bases of HH responses in our\\\\nHH survey and they themselves may not have been part of the HH sample.\\\\nTherefore we conducted a second round of survey to interview such elites/elite\\\\nHHs personally [6] . This survey will be referred to as \\\\u2018Elite survey\\\\u2019. The core\\\\nof the analysis of this paper, on the characteristics and behaviour of the local\\\\nrural elites, is mainly based on this Elite survey.\\\\n#### **2.2 Localized institution: measuring dependence, elites,** **clients**\\\\n\\\\nOur quantitative identification of the elites is based on the following core\\\\nunderlying principles. First, dependence is embedded in day to day activities, both economic and socio-political. Access to inputs of production,\\\\nmarket access for products, dispute resolution and participation in political\\\\nprocess are a few examples of such activities. The second aspect of dependence is *personalized interaction* . This is distinct from formal institutional\\\\ninteractions. Borrowing from banks, approaching police stations for dispute\\\\nresolution etc. are instances of formal institutional interactions, while borrowing from informal lenders, approaching local political leaders for dispute\\\\n\\\\n5 Very similar institutional features are corroborated by Ananthpur et al. (2014) in\\\\ntheir micro-study in Karnataka (a state different from the ones from which we collected\\\\ndata)\\\\n6 This took place one year after the HH survey\\\\u2013in the second half of 2014.\\\\n\\\\n8\\\\n\\\\nresolution are personalized interactions. These two aspects together imply\\\\nthat the dependence structure we are exploring is essentially localized in nature. Finally, high concentration and interlinkage of dependence links are\\\\nindicators of stronger localized power.\\\\nRecall that the primitive in this context in our set-up are the households\\\\u2019\\\\nlinks for getting help in social, economic and political spheres. If HH *M*\\\\nreceives an economic, social or political service from HH *N*, then HH *M* is\\\\nsaid to have an **outgoing service link** to household *N* . We also classify\\\\noutgoing service links into two groups - *crucial and non-crucial* - based on\\\\ntheir relative importance. This classification is based on our perception and\\\\njudgment. For instance, a service-link of seeking advice for resolution of\\\\nhousehold disputes is categorized as non-crucial whereas seeking advice for\\\\nprofession-related disputes is categorized as crucial. Admittedly, this classification is subjective but not arbitrary. The full list of services, classified as\\\\n( *i* ) economic/social/political and ( *ii* ) crucial/non-crucial is given in Table 1a.\\\\nSince we asked each surveyed household whether such services are reciprocated, we also have data on outgoing links from Household *N* to Household\\\\n*M* . In case, Household *M* is also part of our sample, we have an independent verification of such claims (we could not make such cross-verification *in*\\\\n*general* though) [7] .\\\\nNote that, in our network data, there can be multiple such service-links\\\\nbetween two nodes: i.e., households. First we aggregate these to a single\\\\ndimension, called **dependence-connection** . To capture relative strength\\\\nof dependence relation, we classify dependence-connections into three types.\\\\nType *A* : HH *M* is said to have Type *A* outgoing dependence-connection to\\\\nHH *N* only if *M* has exactly one crucial outgoing service-link to *N* . A single\\\\nnon-crucial link is unlikely to be an indicator of clientelistic relation.\\\\nType *B* : HH *M* is said to have Type *B* outgoing dependence-connection to\\\\nHH *N* only if *M* has at least two outgoing links to *N* that are of similar kind,\\\\neither all economic or all social or all political. This captures interlinkages\\\\nin received services .\\\\n\\\\nType *C* : HH *M* is said to have Type *C* outgoing dependence connection\\\\nto HH *N* only if ( *i* ) *M* has at least two outgoing links to *N* and ( *ii* ) not\\\\nall of them are of similar kind (economic/social/political) of services. This\\\\ncaptures interlinkage in different spheres of daily/usual interactions.\\\\n\\\\n7 In case of mismatch, though such instances are rare, claims of the household which\\\\nhas received the service is accepted.\\\\n\\\\n9\\\\n\\\\nClearly we make the definition of dependence more demanding as we\\\\nmove from Type A to Type C. Since (clientelistic) dependence should be conceived as an asymmetric power relation (in contrast to a reciprocal relationship like friendship), we exclude all bilateral, mutual outgoing dependenceconnections from our network. Directed cycles of higher length are rare in\\\\nour data. Thus HH *M* is said to be **dependent** on HH *N* if ( *i* ) HH *M* has\\\\na dependence-connection of at least one type to HH *N* and ( *ii* ) HH *N* does\\\\nnot have any type of dependence-connection to HH *M* .\\\\nThis completes the description of *dependence network* for a village.\\\\nNext we use this derived network data to identify the presence and pattern of clientelist institution in surveyed villages. If a clientelist network is\\\\npresent then it would be characterized by patrons and clients. It is expected\\\\nthat clients will be dependent on patron(s) for various (often interlinked)\\\\nservices and a number of clients will be dependent on a patron. Thus a \\\\u2018hub\\\\nand spoke\\\\u2019 type network is expected to emerge in such villages. To this end,\\\\nwe define a patron, called **elite** as follows. *If more than 5% of the sampled*\\\\n*households are dependent on a household X then X is potentially an impor-*\\\\n*tant patronage-provider in the village and is called an elite* . This captures\\\\nconcentration of dependence in our network data. A household which is dependent on at least one elite is called a **client** . Any household, which is\\\\nneither a client nor an elite will be called a **non-client** . In Figures 1 and 2\\\\n(given at the end) we show dependence-connection networks of two villages,\\\\none with presence of elites and another without.\\\\nA couple of comments are due at this stage. First, since we have not\\\\ndone census for all of the sample villages, we only see the village dependence\\\\nnetworks partially. We can not rule out presence of additional hubs in the\\\\ndependence network for some villages and our elite-identification could be\\\\nincomplete. Second, as mentioned above, other than mutual dependence,\\\\nhigher order directed cycles are rare in our village networks. Therefore, more\\\\ncomplicated network centrality measures (as in, e.g., Herings et al., 2005) are\\\\nsomewhat superfluous for our purpose and we choose to stick to the simple\\\\ndefinition of elites described above.\\\\nIn our sample, we observe considerable heterogeneity across regions. Out\\\\nof 36 sampled villages, 14 villages have no elites and 22 villages have at least\\\\none elite. We have identified 50 elites and 480 clients in 22 villages. Statewise division of elites is as follows: 15 elites in 8 villages of (Eastern) Uttar\\\\nPradesh, 16 elites in 6 villages of Maharashtra and 19 elites in 8 villages of\\\\nOdisha. During the \\\\u2018Elite survey\\\\u2019, we tried to interview all the elites but\\\\n\\\\n10\\\\n\\\\ndue to refusal and non-availability, we could meet only 40 of them - 14 in\\\\n(Eastern) Uttar Pradesh, 7 in Maharashtra and 19 in Odisha.\\\\n### **3 Results**\\\\n\\\\nEven before getting into the discussion about the characteristics and behaviour of the elite HHs, the first striking feature which emerges from the\\\\nlast paragraph is that *the presence of clientelistic institutions, as measured*\\\\n*by us, is not uniform.* In each of the states both elite and non-elite villages\\\\nexist! Thus, rural institutions in India do not seem to be prone for any\\\\nsweeping generalizations.\\\\n#### **3.1 Profile of elite households: their economic deci-** **sions**\\\\n\\\\n*Elite and non-elite households are different in terms of some* \\\\u2018 *endowment\\\\u2019*\\\\n*characteristics*\\\\n\\\\nFirst we focus on a few endowment-like characteristics of elites and non-elite\\\\n\\\\nhouseholds. A summary of these differences is available in Table 3. We find\\\\nthat compared to non-elites, elites are more likely to belong to upper castes,\\\\nhave more land-holding, have higher non-land wealth score, more likely to\\\\nbe in stable occupations and more likely to have a royal or landlord heritage.\\\\nThese differences are statistically significant at 1% level of significance (based\\\\non two sided t-tests also reported in Table 3).\\\\nSpecifically, we find that while 82.5% of elites are either of upper caste or\\\\nOBC (the rest being SC/ST and Muslims), only 52.8% of non-elites are so.\\\\nOccupational pattern of elite households reveals that more than 50% of such\\\\nhouseholds have a steady source of income (which is measured as the main\\\\noccupation being a salaried position or operating a business or a factory).\\\\nFor the non-elite households, the corresponding fraction is drastically lower:\\\\nonly about 7%.\\\\nThe average size of land-holding in acres for elite households is 0.842 [8] but\\\\nless than half that (0.348) for non-elite households.\\\\nWe also construct the non-land assets wealth index by taking the sum of\\\\n\\\\n8 However, informal anecdotal discussion within some villages revealed that land-holding\\\\nof several elite HHs were under-reported as is often usual in Indian villages.\\\\n\\\\n11\\\\n\\\\nfive dummy variables each representing whether the household has one type\\\\nof non-land asset like automobiles, tractor etc (see the detailed definition in\\\\nTable 2). Average non-land wealth-index score for elite household is 2.58\\\\n(out of a maximum of 5) compared to 1.01 for non-elite households.\\\\nThese comparisons show that our identified elite households are mainly from\\\\nwealthy and socially dominant sections. Moreover these features also indicate\\\\nthe asymmetric nature of the dependence-connections as a result of which our\\\\ndependence network is quite different from other kinds of social networks (for\\\\nexample, like a friendship network) that have homophily as a primary feature.\\\\n\\\\n*Occupational structure in elite households and its dynamics*\\\\n\\\\n81% of elite households report that they still consider farming as one of their\\\\nmain sources of earning. However 30% of such households report business or\\\\nfactory production as another main source of the household income.Only 3%\\\\nof the elite households depend primarily on sources other than farming or\\\\nbusiness (mostly salaried). Therefore, elite households have *diversified* quite\\\\na bit into non-agricultural occupations. This finding is in conformity with\\\\nthe recent literature. However, it is also clear that elite households have not\\\\nmoved away substantially from agriculture yet.\\\\nIn Table 4 we split the distribution of occupation along age (below and above\\\\n40) and gender. One quite interesting finding is that among the young females within such HHs there is a considerable rise in acquisition of skills\\\\nand/or taking up business-related occupation.\\\\n\\\\n*Landholding and its dynamics*\\\\n\\\\nSo far as land-ownership is concerned, we believe that there is huge underreporting in our data as well as in official statistics. It is instructive to note\\\\nthat India may have unique identification number for every citizen but its\\\\nland record data is notoriously poor. As reported by the elite households, at\\\\nleast 84% of the households have at least one acre of land. However, informal\\\\nconversation in some villages in Maharashtra and UP (outside the formal interviews) throw up figures like between 30 to 50 acres for some households.\\\\nStill, these numbers are nowhere close to that of erstwhile big landlords.\\\\nAmong the elite HHs only 30% of them report that their ancestors were erstwhile royals or landlords. So it is safe to conclude that land has ceased to\\\\nbe the *sole* source of power. But at the same time, local elites are holding\\\\n\\\\n12\\\\n\\\\non to their land. Below 10 percent of elite households admitted that they\\\\nhave sold land in last 10 years. In contrast, about 13% of elite households\\\\nreported that they purchased land in the last 5 years. Further, when land\\\\nhas been sold, never was the purpose some non-agricultural investment. The\\\\npurposes were either for purchasing some other piece of land or for some\\\\ntemporary household need. Therefore, in spite of increasing diversification\\\\nof occupations within such households, land remains a primary (but not the\\\\nonly) form of asset.\\\\n\\\\n*Nature of investment decisions*\\\\n\\\\nWe asked each elite household some details of the nature of their investment\\\\ndecisions in the last five years. Quite startlingly, 62% of such households\\\\ndo not report any investment at all for that time span. Among those who\\\\ninvested, 32% of the households made investment for productive purposes\\\\nlike purchasing new tractors/harvesters, or starting some new business etc.\\\\nOnly 8% of the households invested in purchasing stocks or shares or gold or\\\\nin local lending business. Therefore, rural elites, it seems, in spite of some\\\\noccupational diversifications, are still not substantially into entrepreneurial\\\\n\\\\nactivities.\\\\n\\\\nOne noticeable feature is that both among the school-going and college-going\\\\nmembers of such households, fraction of those attending (usually more expensive) private institutions is higher than those attending government institutions. This indicates that the elite households are investing into human\\\\ncapital for their children too.\\\\n#### **3.2 Source of power?**\\\\n\\\\nKrishna (2003) attributed the rise of new \\\\u2018elite\\\\u2019-entrants to decentralization\\\\nof governance. He argued that educated youth found new political space\\\\nwhich was hitherto unavailable. Their capacity to mediate between administration and villagers gave them electoral advantage over traditional elites.\\\\nOur findings do not entirely support the above narrative. Only about 46% of\\\\nelites have held panchayat (rural local government) positions or were political party functionaries. Thus it seems that political office is not a necessary\\\\ncondition for political influence. For a couple of villages in UP, anecdotal\\\\nevidence in fact suggests that the *pradhan* (head of the village-level local\\\\ngovernment) is actually a dummy for the local traditional landlord elements.\\\\n\\\\n13\\\\n\\\\nBut we found evidence about the opposite phenomenon too, especially in\\\\nMaharashtra. About 15% of the elites hold position in religious and caste organizations, which are informal bodies. Moreover, 50% elite households have\\\\nrelatives in influential social and political positions, which indicates that dynastic power matters as much as individual entrepreneurship in the arena of\\\\nformal politics.\\\\nFinally we try to locate the elites\\\\u2019 sphere of influence as reported by\\\\nthe elites themselves. Elites typically have control over and are involved in\\\\ndisbursal of different kinds of resources. We classify such activities (the \\\\u2018local\\\\nsevices\\\\u2019 provided) into three categories: economic (E), political (P) and social\\\\n(S). Details are available in Table 1b. We find that 61% of the elite households\\\\nare active in all of the three spheres: E, P and S (details about the pattern\\\\nof patronage-service provision are summarized in Table 5). Quite strikingly\\\\nwe find that elite households providing only economic services constitute\\\\n18% of our cohort. However, there exists no elite households which provide\\\\nonly political or social services. Thus, the notion that control over economic\\\\nresources has become unimportant for understanding the contour of rural\\\\npower is not borne out by our investigation. Rather, we find that control over\\\\neconomic resources, a variety of them - not just land, still plays a significant\\\\nrole. Moreover, exercising influence over different interlinked spheres of rural\\\\nlife is clearly important.\\\\n### **4 Summary and concluding remarks**\\\\n\\\\nThe first point to note is that the rural elites identified via our methodology\\\\nconform partially, but not totally, with the common subjective perceptions:\\\\nthat such HHs are predominantly wealthy, having stable sources of income,\\\\nhaving often, but not always connection with formal political power etc.\\\\nThus, our work is like a counterpart to the interesting findings in the research\\\\nby Cruz et al. (2017) (also notable in this context is Naidu et al., 2017).\\\\nSecondly, in the context of India we find substantial variation in terms of\\\\nthe prevalence of clientelistic institutions within rural societies. Thirdly, the\\\\nrural elites, power centres within the villages and surrounding localities, cease\\\\nto be exclusively from the erstwhile landlord lineage, but still hold land as\\\\none of the primary forms of economic asset. However, in such HHs, quite a\\\\nbit of occupational diversity has taken place, but that has failed to induce\\\\nmany such HHs into productive investments. Finally, the source of power\\\\n\\\\n14\\\\n\\\\nof such HHs usually straddles several spheres of rural life and never in our\\\\nstudy do we find that the source of power is exclusively in social or political\\\\nspheres.\\\\nA natural question is of measuring the impact of such clientalistic institutional variations on outcomes. These are taken up, in the context of HH-level\\\\nprovision of workfare-jobs, in Bhattacharya, Kar and Nandi (2017) and in the\\\\ncontext of village-level provision of mainly public sevices in Bhattacharya,\\\\nKar and Nandi (2018).\\\\n### **References**\\\\n\\\\n1.

The target sample\\\\nsize was 3600 households based on cost restrictions. As mentioned above,\\\\none of the key information that this survey aimed to collect was the local\\\\ndependence structure and so it was essential to collect information from all\\\\nor a sizeable number of households in each village. So, As a result it was\\\\ndecided to select and interview approximately 100 households from each of\\\\nthe selected villages which meant that 36 villages could be selected in the\\\\nsample.\\\\nIndia is a vast country with 29 states and 7 union territories and each of\\\\nthese regions are culturally and politically different with many policies being\\\\nimplemented at the regional level. To be able to control for these state level\\\\neffects it was decided to confine the sample to three states (with 12 villages\\\\nfrom each state) so that we had sufficient sample sizes at the state level.\\\\nThe three states chosen were Odisha, Maharashtra and (the Eastern part) of\\\\nUttar Pradesh (UP). These three states or sub-state regions were chosen for\\\\nthe following reasons. First, these states are located in three different parts\\\\nof India: Maharashtra in the west, Odisha in the east and UP in the northern\\\\npart. Secondly, each of these is a major state in India with each having a major different predominant language-based ethnic group. Third, these states\\\\nhave experienced several different historical types of administrative and landrevenue systems during the colonial period (permanent settlement, princely\\\\nstates, taluqdari systems, ryotwari system) which have been shown to have\\\\naffected the development of post-colonial institutions, and in turn, current\\\\neconomic outcomes. Finally, measuring the institutional impacts of left-wing\\\\nextremist (LWE hereafter) politics on rural household outcomes was one of\\\\nour research goals. So, another reason for choosing these states is that LWE\\\\nactivities are prevalent in some parts of each of these states.\\\\n\\\\n*Stage 1: Selecting blocks using a stratified design*\\\\n\\\\nOur main research goal was to measure the effect of local level dependence\\\\nstructure on rural household and village level outcomes. But as these local\\\\nlevel dependence structures are known to vary by a number of regional factors, we decided to increase the variability of the sample in terms of the local\\\\nlevel dependence structures by stratifying the sample by these factors. To\\\\n\\\\n25\\\\n\\\\nincrease the variability of the sample along a number of characteristics and\\\\nto ensure enough sample sizes for one of the variables of interest, left wing\\\\nextremism, it was decided to stratify the sample along the characteristics as\\\\nspecified below. Most of the information about these stratification variables\\\\nwere available either at the district or at the block (a smaller geographical\\\\nunit than the district) level. So, it was decided to first select blocks from each\\\\nof the different strata using probability proportion to size (PPS) sampling\\\\nwhere size was measured by the number of households in the block (as in\\\\n2001 Census of India, the latest that was available to us) and then select a\\\\nvillage randomly from the selected blocks again using PPS sampling method\\\\nwhere size was measured by the number of households in the village. The\\\\ncharacteristics we used for stratification for each state subsample were as\\\\nfollows:\\\\n\\\\n  Whether the block had experienced left wing extremist activities (L)\\\\nor not (NL) between the period 2005 to 2010. This was identified using\\\\na number of different sources.\\\\n\\\\n  Whether the district containing the block was in a coastal (C) or noncoastal region (NC). This was done directly by using maps. Coastal\\\\nregions were are expected to have occupational diversity while people\\\\nin more interior regions (non-coastal) are expected to be mainly in\\\\nagricultural occupation. To be able to identify different types of dependence, not only predominantly agriculture-based dependence links,\\\\nthe sample was also stratified by coastal and non-coastal region.\\\\n\\\\n  Whether historically the district was under ryotwari (R) or non-ryotwari\\\\n(NR) system during the colonial rule. This was identified using the classification provided by Banerjee and Iyer (2005). These historical administrative and land-revenue systems are known to affect post-colonial\\\\n\\\\ninstitutions.\\\\n\\\\nEvery state did not include all 8 combinations, so we ended up with 13\\\\nmutually exclusive and exhaustive strata within the three states (see the\\\\nTable below). with the added constraint that 12 blocks would have to be\\\\nselected from each region. As some analysis would look at the LWE impact\\\\nwe also decided that there should be a sufficient number of villages from the\\\\nLWE stratum. We also needed to select 12 blocks from each state. Our\\\\n\\\\nresulting stratification strategy is described in the Table below.\\\\n\\\\n26\\\\n\\\\nStratum No. State Stratum Number of blocks\\\\n\\\\n1 Eastern UP L,NC,NR 4\\\\n2 Eastern UP NL,NC,NR 8\\\\n3 Odisha L,CO,NR 2\\\\n4 Odisha L,NC,NR 3\\\\n5 Odisha L,NC,RY 1\\\\n6 Odisha NL,CO,NR 2\\\\n7 Odisha NL,NC,NR 3\\\\n8 Odisha NL,NC,RY 1\\\\n9 Maharashtra L,NC,NR 4\\\\n10 Maharashtra NL,CO,NR 1\\\\n11 Maharashtra NL,CO,RY 2\\\\n12 Maharashtra NL,NC,NR 2\\\\n13 Maharashtra NL,NC,RY 3\\\\n\\\\n*Stage 2: Assigning selected blocks to forest and non-forest sub-samples*\\\\n\\\\nAt the next sampling stage was we selected one village from each selected\\\\nblock. In the first sampling stage one of the variables we had stratified by\\\\nwas LWE activity. But as blocks are large areas with on average 170 villages\\\\n(and 50% of blocks have more than 150 villages but 99% of blocks have less\\\\nthan 550 villages), not all villages in an LWE affected block will be affected\\\\nby LWE activity. As it was extremely difficult to get precise information\\\\non exactly which of the several hundreds of villages in a block has a history\\\\nof LWE activities, we decided to indirectly screen for LWE affected villages\\\\nby selecting villages in these LWE affected blocks that were very near to\\\\nforest. We used this strategy because forest cover has been found to be\\\\nhighly correlated with LWE activity at least at the district level and there\\\\nis anecdotal evidence that LWE organisations mainly base their activities in\\\\ndense forests as state forces find it difficult to enter these areas. We decided\\\\nto draw two sub-samples from these LWE affected blocks - one from areas\\\\nnext to forests and the other from areas away from forests. We did this\\\\nby collecting maps of forest cover from the Geological Survey of India and\\\\nthe Forest Research Institute and then overlaying thoese on the maps of\\\\nvillages. We decided to assign the following number of blocks to the forest\\\\nand non-forest sub-samples of the LWE based strata.\\\\n\\\\n  Eastern UP- L,NC,NR stratum:: As one of the 4 selected blocks in\\\\n\\\\n27\\\\n\\\\nthis strata no forested village, this block was automatically assigned to\\\\nthe Non-forested Sub-Sample and the remaining blocks in that strata,\\\\nsince they summed up to the assigned number of blocks for the Forest\\\\nSub-Sample, were allocated to the Forest Sub-Sample.\\\\n\\\\n  Odisha - L,CO,NR stratum: As one of the selected blocks had no\\\\nforested village, this block was automatically assigned to the Nonforested Sub-Sample and the remaining blocks in that strata, since\\\\nthey summed up to the assigned number of blocks for the Forest SubSample, were allocated to the Forest Sub-Sample.\\\\n\\\\n  Odisha - L,NC,NR stratum: We selected 2 out of the 3 blocks by PPS,\\\\nwhere size measure was the proportion of households in forested villages\\\\nin these blocks, for the Forest Sub-Sample.\\\\n\\\\n  Odisha - L,NC,RY stratum: The only selected block from this stratum\\\\nwas automatically assigned to the Forest Sub-Sample.\\\\n\\\\n  Maharashtra - L,NC,NR strata: We selected 3 out of the 4 blocks by\\\\nPPS where size measure was the proportion of households in forested\\\\nvillages in these blocks, for the Forest Sub-Sample.\\\\n\\\\n*Stage 3: Selecting villages from selected blocks*\\\\n\\\\nFinally we selected one village from each of the 36 selected blocks using PPS\\\\nwhere size is measured by the total number of households in the village. In\\\\ntwo of the villages selected in Maharashtra, battle between the Indian Security Forces and the LWE militants raged when the HH household survey\\\\nwas to start (in March-April, 2013). So, we had to replace these two villages\\\\nby two other (safer) villages in the same or adjacent districts with similar\\\\nadministrative and land-revenue history and similar geographical features.\\\\n\\\\n*Stage 4: Selecting households from selected villages*\\\\n\\\\nIn villages where the total number of households was less than 100, all households were selected for survey. In each village where the total number of\\\\nhouseholds was more than 100, upto 110 households were selected using simple random sampling. The sampling frame used was the most recent electoral\\\\nroll for those villages. The target was to interview at least 100 households\\\\n\\\\n28\\\\n\\\\nin each village and at most 110 households. In cases, where due to attrition,\\\\nnon-response etc with the initially chosen sample of HHswe could not reach\\\\nthe target sample size of 100, additional households were selected from the\\\\nremaining households in the village again using simple random sampling to\\\\nreach the target sample size. This was repeated until the target sample size\\\\nwas reached. In the final sample, 21 of the sampled villages included less\\\\nthan 50% of the HHs in the villages, 5 included 50-60% of the HHs in the\\\\nvillages, 3 included 60-70% of the HHs in the villages, 2 included 80-95% of\\\\nthe HHs in the villages and 4 were village censuses.\\\\n\\\\n29\\\\n\\\\n\\\"}\",\"annotations\":null}", "type": "function_call_output"}}

This paper presents a long-term place recognition dataset for use in mobile localization under\\\\nlarge-scale dynamic environments. This dataset includes a campus-scale track and a city-scale track. The campus\\\\ntrack focuses on the long-term property and is recorded with a LiDAR device and an omnidirectional camera on 10\\\\ntrajectories. Each trajectory is repeatedly recorded 8 times under variant illumination conditions. The city track focuses\\\\non the large-scale property and is recorded only with the LiDAR device on 120 km trajectory, which contains open\\\\nstreets, residential areas, natural terrains, etc. They include 200 hours of raw data of all kinds of scenarios within\\\\nurban environments. The ground truth position for both tracks is provided on each trajectory, obtained from the Global\\\\nPosition System with an additional General ICP-based point cloud refinement. To simplify the evaluation procedure, we\\\\nalso provide the Python-API with a set of place recognition metrics proposed to quickly load our dataset and evaluate\\\\nthe recognition performance against different methods. This dataset targets finding methods with high place recognition\\\\naccuracy and robustness and providing real robotic systems with long-term autonomy.

In real-world environments, nevertheless,\\\\nplace recognition has been studied for decades Lowry et al.\\\\n(2016), reliable long-term and large-scale localization is still\\\\nan unsolved problem. Recent years, noticeable developments\\\\nin autonomous driving and last-mile delivery along with the\\\\nincreased demand for long-term, large-scale, and repeated\\\\n(2LR) localization have been witnessed. Unlike the shortterm SLAM tasks, the 2LR localization includes both spatial\\\\nand temporary differences, and the existing datasets are\\\\neither too complicated or too simple for evaluation methods.\\\\nTo assess the performance in localization tasks, most new\\\\nrecognition methods must be evaluated on previous exiting\\\\ndatasets, even with unique place feature encoding ability.\\\\n\\\\nWith recent developments in computer vision, new\\\\nlearning- and non-learning-based, vision- and LiDARbased place recognition methods have been proposed to\\\\nimprove the recognition performance under viewpoint and\\\\nappearance differences.

Even the most recent\\\\nplace recognition approaches, LPDNet Liu et al. (2019) and\\\\nOverlapNet Chen et al. (2021) are mainly claimed stateof-the-art performance over limited test datasets, and few\\\\nmethods have a reasonable number of real-world evaluations.\\\\n\\\\nThis paper presents ALITA, a dataset set for long-term\\\\nplace recognition in large-scale environments. Our datasets\\\\ncontain two tracks: (1) *Urban* dataset, which records LiDAR\\\\ndata inputs in a city-scale urban-like area for 50 segments and\\\\n120 *km* trajectory in total. And (2) *Campus* dataset, recorded\\\\n\\\\n*Prepared using* *sagej.cls*\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nunder a campus-scale environment, where we gathered the\\\\nomnidirectional visual inputs and LiDAR inputs on 10\\\\ndifferent trajectories for 8 repeated times, under different\\\\nilluminations and viewpoints; this dataset targets long-term\\\\nlocalization challenge. Figure. 1 and Figure. 2 gives a better\\\\nvisualization of its scale, and Table. 1 shows the comparison\\\\nof different datasets. Most datasets are targeted at short-term,\\\\nfixed conditions or viewpoints place recognition tasks, so it\\\\nis hard to evaluate the localization performance in real-world\\\\nlong-term, large-scale applications. Compared to existing\\\\n\\\\n*Yin et al.:* ***ALITA: A Large-scale Place Recognition Dataset for Long-term Autonomy.*** 3\\\\n\\\\n\\\\ndatasets, our *Urban* dataset covers variant 3D scenarios for\\\\ncomprehensive 3D place recognition evaluation and multisession SLAM Van Opdenbosch and Steinbach (2019); Tian\\\\net al. (2022). And our *Campus* dataset repeatedly covers\\\\ndiverse campus areas with dynamic objects, illumination,\\\\nand viewpoint differences, which is suitable to evaluate longterm re-localization or incremental learning ability.\\\\nBoth *Urban* and *Campus* datasets provide the ground\\\\ntruth for the exact place recognition to help evaluate\\\\ndifferent methods. The *Urban* dataset has been used\\\\n\\\\nin the IEEE ICRA 2022 *[General Place Recognition](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/icra2022-general-place-recognition-city-scale-ugv-localization)*\\\\n*[Competition](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/icra2022-general-place-recognition-city-scale-ugv-localization)* to benchmark the current new 3D place\\\\nrecognition approaches. This paper describes the details of\\\\nboth datasets and provides the Python-API for the whole\\\\npipeline of data processing and localization evaluation in\\\\n[https://github.com/MetaSLAM/ALITA.](https://github.com/MetaSLAM/ALITA)\\\\n\\\\n**Related works**\\\\n\\\\n*Place Recognition*\\\\n\\\\nBased on the natural robustness of the LiDAR against illumination variant, loads of LiDAR-based place recognition\\\\nmethods have been developed. The success of PointNet Qi\\\\net al. (2017) makes it possible to extract the features from the\\\\npoint cloud directly and, therefore Uy and Lee (2018) convert\\\\nthe local features utilizing PointNet into a global descriptor\\\\nvia a NetVLAD layer Arandjelovic et al. (2016). However,\\\\npoint-based methods suffer from the fixed point number\\\\nof input which cannot provide many structural details, and\\\\ngiant model size, which leads to low computation efficiency\\\\nand high computation cost. Komorowski (2021) use sparse\\\\n3D convolutions on a voxelized point cloud to extract local\\\\nfeatures. The introduction of sparse 3d convolution accelerates the process of local feature extraction and extracts\\\\nthe features within the points in each local neighborhood.\\\\nNevertheless, most point-based and voxel-based methods\\\\nare sensitive to viewpoint differences common in real-life\\\\nrobot navigation. Some projection-based methods Kim and\\\\nKim (2018), Chen et al. (2021), Yin et al. (2020), Ma\\\\net al. (2022) claim viewpoint invariant. Our dataset aims\\\\nto offer good test cases for models to test their robustness\\\\nunder different viewpoints and translation differences. In the\\\\nUrban dataset, we provide python API to generate query\\\\nand database frames based on the user\\\\u2019s requirements. The\\\\nCampus dataset provides forward and reversed loop closures\\\\nwith dynamic object disturbance.\\\\n\\\\n*Existing Datasets*\\\\n\\\\nTable. 1 summaries a set of outdoor place recognition\\\\ndatasets. *Freiburg* and *Ford Campus* are both collected in\\\\ncampus environments, but the insufficient size makes it hard\\\\nto train large networks. *KITTI* Geiger et al. (2013) is recorded\\\\nby a data collection device, including a 64-beam LiDAR\\\\n(Velodyne HDL-64E) mounted on the car in Karlsruhe.\\\\nThere are slight viewpoint changes, and most of the revisit is\\\\nin the same direction. *KITTI360* Liao et al. (2021) contains\\\\nmore reverse revisit, but temporal diversity is also not\\\\nconsidered. *NCLT* Carlevaris-Bianco et al. (2016) contains\\\\ntimes changes in the Campus for 15 months, which includes\\\\nseasonal changes and repeated sequences that can improve\\\\n\\\\n*Prepared using* *sagej.cls*\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nthe model\\\\u2019s robustness during training. *Oxford* Maddern\\\\net al. (2017) is collected by a car-mounted device and covers\\\\nthe same 10 *km* route twice every week for a year. However,\\\\nthe scene these two datasets contain is limited to a single\\\\nplace, which lacks geographical diversity. Our proposed\\\\ndataset contains around 170 *km* long trajectories split into\\\\ntwo sections Urban and Campus. *Urban* dataset contains\\\\n120 *km* of trajectories which provide abundant frames and\\\\nstructural diversity(building, forest, etc.). The 50 *km Campus*\\\\ndataset provides deliberate revisit in both directions along\\\\nwith temporal and illumination diversity (day and night)\\\\nPlace recognition methods can not only contribute to\\\\nthe SLAM system to alleviate localization shift but be\\\\nessential to large map merging systems. Yin et al. (2022)\\\\nhas proven the application of place recognition in offline\\\\nand real-time map merging. *MulRan* Kim et al. (2020)\\\\ncontains various types of revisit, such as reverse revisit\\\\nand lane-level revisit. In addition, the dataset is recorded\\\\nin different environments. Even though loads of datasets\\\\nemphasize deliberately designed revisit, they omit the revisit\\\\nbetween different trajectories, and the spatial scale is limited\\\\nto relatively small areas. In ALITA, we provide trajectories\\\\nwith overlaps with adjacent ones both in *Urban* and *Campus*,\\\\nwhich makes it possible for methods to evaluate either cityscale or campus-scale environments.\\\\n\\\\n**The Platform**\\\\n\\\\nOur data collection platform contains a Velodyne VLP16 LiDAR scanner, Xsens MTI-300 inertial measurement\\\\nunits, and an Nvidia Jetson TX2 onboard computer.\\\\nFor the extrinsic calibration between LiDAR and inertial\\\\n\\\\nmeasurement units, we follow the method mentioned\\\\n[in https://github.com/ethz-asl/lidar align. For the](https://github.com/ethz-asl/lidar_align) *Urban*\\\\ndataset, we mount our platform onto the top of a mobile\\\\nvehicle and parallel with the GNSS position system to record\\\\nthe ground truth positions in the city-scale environments. As\\\\nshown in Fig. 3, for the *Campus* dataset, we mount the same\\\\nplatform onto the mobile rover robot, and with an additional\\\\nTHETA V omnidirectional camera on the top of the LiDAR\\\\ndevice; this setup can provide time-synced LiDAR inputs and\\\\n360 visual inputs.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Figure 3.

Especially, *Urban* are also designed for the mapmerging systems. As shown in Fig. 4, each trajectory is at\\\\nleast overlapped at one junction with the others, and there\\\\nare 158 overlaps in total within the dataset.\\\\n**Campus dataset** consists of 10 trajectories collected\\\\nwithin the campus area of Carnegie Mellon University(CMU), and the total length is around 36 *km* . Each\\\\ntrajectory is recorded eight times under different conditions(illumination, direction): as shown in Fig. 4, we have\\\\nfour types of combinations and recorded them two times\\\\neach. Even within a relatively small area, *Campus* contains buildings, corridors, and crossroads, providing sufficient structural diversity for place recognition evaluation.\\\\nMoreover, omnidirectional pictures with position labels are\\\\nprovided, *Campus* are also be utilized for visual place recognition evaluation under different viewpoint and illumination\\\\nconditions. Same as *Urban*, there is a total of 9 overlaps.\\\\n\\\\n*Data Description and Format*\\\\n\\\\nEach trajectory of the Urban dataset consists of 3 types of\\\\ndata, described as follows:\\\\n\\\\n   *Global Maps* : Global maps are processed to contain\\\\nthe 3D structure of each trajectory, which is provided\\\\n\\\\n*Prepared using* *sagej.cls*\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nin Point Cloud Data (PCD) file format. We use\\\\nself-developed LiDAR-Inertial odometry based on\\\\nLOAM Zhang and Singh (2014) to generate global\\\\nmaps and process the maps with a VoxelGrid filter.\\\\n\\\\n   *odometry* : We save the key poses generated by\\\\nour SLAM algorithm as odometry information and\\\\nprovide them in (TXT) file format. The key poses are\\\\nwithin the local coordinate of each trajectory, and the\\\\ndistance between adjacent poses is around 1 *m* .\\\\n   - *Raw Data* : In order to offer convenience for map\\\\nmerging tasks, the raw data is provided in rosbag\\\\nROS package. Inside the raw data, two ROS topics\\\\n*/imu/data* and */velodyne packets* reveal the inertial\\\\nmeasurement unit and LiDAR data. The frequency of\\\\ntwo ROS topics is 200 *hz* and 10 *hz* .\\\\n\\\\nEach trajectory of the Campus dataset consists of 8\\\\nsequences, and each sequence includes four types of data:\\\\n\\\\n   - *Global Maps* and *Odometry* are the same with *Urban* .\\\\n   - *Unified Odometry* : We utilize interactive SLAM Koide\\\\net al. (2021) to find the geometric relations between\\\\nthe key poses of different sequences within the\\\\nsame trajectory and unify them into the same global\\\\ncoordinate. The data is provided in (TXT) file format.\\\\n   - *Omnidirectional Pictures* : For each key pose, a\\\\ncorresponding omnidirectional picture with resolution\\\\nof 1024 *\\\\u00d7* 512 is provided in (PNG) file format.\\\\n\\\\n*Using the Dataset*\\\\n\\\\nThe PCD files for global maps can be easily visualized\\\\nusing PCL Rusu and Cousins (2011) or Open3D Zhou\\\\net al. (2018) packages and the bag can be played back in\\\\nthe command line by rosbag ROS package.

For *Urban* dataset, we further\\\\nprovide highly personalized query and database frames\\\\ngeneration to evaluate the performance of models on any\\\\ntranslation and viewpoint differences. As the *Urban* dataset\\\\nalso can be used in large-scale map merging tasks, the ground\\\\ntruth of overlap between trajectories is provided in our API.\\\\nTo offer convenience for models to compare with the stateof-art methods, we provide an online evaluation in AIcrowd\\\\nto record each submission.\\\\n\\\\n**Benchmark Experiments**\\\\n\\\\n*Models and Evaluation Methods*\\\\n\\\\nWe select PointNetVLAD Uy and Lee (2018), MinkLoc3D Komorowski (2021) and SphereVLAD Yin et al.\\\\n(2020) as our baseline models. Implementations in their\\\\nofficial Github repository are utilized to train the networks\\\\nfrom scratch on Urban dataset trajectory(01 *\\\\u223c* 10&16 *\\\\u223c*\\\\n20) and the unified training data are available at *[General](https://github.com/MetaSLAM/GPR_Competition)*\\\\n*[Place Recognition Competition](https://github.com/MetaSLAM/GPR_Competition)* . All models are tested in\\\\ntrajectory(21 *\\\\u223c* 41) of the Urban dataset for robustness\\\\nunder two combinations of translation and viewpoint differences denoted as forward and reverse. Queries frames are\\\\ngenerated by uniformly sampling in the range of [ *\\\\u2212* 3 *m \\\\u223c*\\\\n3 *m* ] and [ *\\\\u2212* 5 *[\\\\u25e6]* *\\\\u223c* 5 *[\\\\u25e6]* ] based on database frames for forward\\\\nand [ *\\\\u2212* 3 *m \\\\u223c* 3 *m* ] and [175 *[\\\\u25e6]* *\\\\u223c* 185 *[\\\\u25e6]* ] for reverse. Furthermore, trajectory(01 *\\\\u223c* 06) of *Campus* are utilized to evaluate the generalization ability. We use Average Recall curve of\\\\ntop 20 candidates to show the performance of each method,\\\\nand the Recall@1 is selected to compare each technique\\\\u2019s\\\\nretrieval and generalization ability. A successful retrieval is\\\\ndefined as retrieving a point cloud within 5m for Pittsburgh\\\\nand 3m for the Campus dataset.\\\\n\\\\n*Results*\\\\n\\\\nIn the Urban dataset, PointNetVLAD outperforms the other\\\\nmethods at Recall@1 forward, and SphereVLAD exceeds\\\\nthe other methods at Recall@1 backward. Our PythonAPI can help researchers quickly analyze the recognition\\\\nperformance under variant viewpoints. Because the distance\\\\nbetween adjacent database frames is only around 3m,\\\\nthe Campus dataset can be used to test the precision\\\\nof re-localization. As shown in Fig. 5, all the models\\\\ncannot achieve high recall@1 as in *Urban* and MinkLoc3D\\\\noutperforms other methods both in forward and backward.\\\\n\\\\n*Prepared using* *sagej.cls*\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**4. Summary and Future Work**\\\\n\\\\nIn this paper, we presented ALITA dataset which aims to\\\\nlong-term place recognition tasks in large-scale environments. We believe that this dataset will be helpful in place\\\\nrecognition research in handling illumination and viewpoint\\\\nchanges and expect future LiDAR-Image(Omnidirectional)\\\\nfusion-based robotics research. Since the presented ALITA\\\\ndataset provides abundant overlaps between trajectories, we\\\\nalso expect future usage for map merging systems. We\\\\nprovided codes to help with using the dataset and evaluating\\\\nnew methods with it.\\\\n\\\\n**5.
