Notably, most interpretability\\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\\naccuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:\\ncausal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it\\nbecomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.\\nStudying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal\\nabstraction should lead to exciting future work.\\nLinks: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08802v1||http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08802v1\\nPDF URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08802v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: NeuralOS: Towards Simulating Operating Systems via Neural Generative Models\\nSummary: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user\\ninterfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in\\nresponse to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.\\nNeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer\\nstate, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images.

Although modeling\\nfine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS\\noffers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for\\nfuture human-computer interaction systems.\\nLinks: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08800v1||http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08800v1\\nPDF URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08800v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: KV Cache Steering for Inducing Reasoning in Small Language Models\\nSummary: We propose cache steering, a lightweight method for implicit steering of\\nlanguage models via a one-shot intervention applied directly to the key-value\\ncache. To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce\\nchain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages\\nGPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift\\nmodel behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning\\nor prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning\\nbenchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative\\nstructure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance. Compared to\\nprior activation steering techniques that require continuous interventions, our\\none-shot cache steering offers substantial advantages in terms of\\nhyperparameter stability, inference-time efficiency, and ease of integration,\\nmaking it a more robust and practical solution for controlled generation.\\nLinks: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08799v1||http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08799v1\\nPDF URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08799v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: One Token to Fool LLM-as-a-Judge\\nSummary: Generative reward models (also known as LLMs-as-judges), which use large\\nlanguage models (LLMs) to evaluate answer quality, are increasingly adopted in\\nreinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). They are often preferred\\nover rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving\\nfree-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a\\ncandidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward\\nindicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,\\nwe find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to\\nsuperficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., \\\":\\\" or \\\".\\\") or reasoning\\nopeners like \\\"Thought process:\\\" and \\\"Let's solve this problem step by step.\\\"\\ncan often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is\\nwidespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat\\nfor core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as\\nrejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,\\nwe introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new\\ngenerative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings\\nhighlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods.

We do not assume that $A$ has an\\nidentity. The \\\\emph{multiplier algebra} $M(A)$ is a unital algebra associated\\nto $A$. If we require the product in $A$ to be non-degenerate (as a bilinear\\nform), the multiplier algebra can be characterized as the largest algebra\\ncontaining $A$ as an essential ideal. We recall the basic definitions and\\nprovide some more information about this notion.\\n  We endow the multiplier algebra $M(A)$ with the {\\\\it strict topology}. Then\\nwe show that $A$ is dense in $M(A)$ if and only if there exist local units in\\n$A$.\\n  We include various examples. In particular, we are interested in the\\nunderlying algebras of multiplier Hopf algebras, algebraic quantum groups,\\nalgebraic quantum hypergroups, weak multiplier Hopf algebras and algebraic\\nquantum groupoids. In all these cases, one can show that the algebras have\\nlocal units. We have also included some examples arising from co-Frobenius\\ncoalgebras.\\n  For most of the material treated in this note, it is only the ring structure\\nof the algebra that plays a role. For this reason, we develop the theory here\\nfor rings. But they are not required to have an identity for the multiplicative\\nstructure.\\nLinks: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08769v1||http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08769v1\\nPDF URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08769v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: Dually Hierarchical Drift Adaptation for Online Configuration Performance Learning\\nSummary: Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate\\nconfiguration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic\\nenvironments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates\\nwill inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,\\nwhich reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and\\nlocal drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,\\nexisting offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to\\nthese implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration\\nperformance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online\\nconfiguration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to\\nthese drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the\\nlocal and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper\\nlevel, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the\\nlocal model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the\\nlower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and\\nadapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA\\ncombines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize\\nredundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight\\nsoftware systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA\\nachieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with\\nup to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to\\nimprove different local models in handling concept drift.\\nLinks: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08730v1||http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08730v1\\nPDF URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08730v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: SPLASH! Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical demonstrations\\nSummary: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for\\nlearning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most\\napproaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which\\nis often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations\\nare not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable\\nrobot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting\\na critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic\\nagents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement\\nlearning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical\\ndemonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from\\nsuboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We\\nempirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,\\nand demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation\\nexperiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed\\nmethods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward\\nlearning from suboptimal demonstrations.\\nLinks: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08707v1||http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08707v1\\nPDF URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08707v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: elsciRL: Integrating Language Solutions into Reinforcement Learning Problem Settings\\nSummary: We present elsciRL, an open-source Python library to facilitate the\\napplication of language solutions on reinforcement learning problems.

However, many existing frameworks depend heavily on manually\\\\npredefined tools and workflows, which hinder their adaptability, scalability, and generalization\\\\nacross domains. In this work, we introduce **Alita** \\\\u2014a generalist agent designed with the principle\\\\nof *\\\\\\\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,\\\\\\\"* enabling scalable agentic reasoning through *minimal*\\\\n*predefinition* and *maximal self-evolution* . For minimal predefinition, Alita is equipped with only one\\\\ncomponent for direct problem-solving, making it much simpler and neater than previous approaches\\\\nthat relied heavily on hand-crafted, elaborate tools and workflows. This clean design enhances\\\\nits potential to generalize to challenging questions, without being limited by tools. For *Maximal*\\\\n*self-evolution*, we enable the creativity of Alita by providing a suite of general-purpose components\\\\nto autonomously construct, refine, and reuse external capabilities by generating task-related model\\\\ncontext protocols (MCPs) from open source, which contributes to scalable agentic reasoning. Notably,\\\\nAlita achieves 75.15% pass@1 and 87.27% pass@3 accuracy, which is top-ranking among generalpurpose agents, on the GAIA benchmark validation dataset, 74.00% and 52.00% pass@1, respectively,\\\\non Mathvista and PathVQA, outperforming many agent systems with far greater complexity. More\\\\n[details will be updated at https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Alita.](https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Alita)\\\\n\\\\n*\\\\u2217* These authors contributed equally to this work.\\\\n\\\\n**1** **Introduction**\\\\n\\\\n*\\\\\\\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\\\\\\\"* \\\\u2014 Leonardo da Vinci\\\\n\\\\nLarge language models (LLMs) have rapidly evolved from merely generating text to autonomous agents capable of\\\\nindependently planning and executing complex tasks on behalf of users with limited human oversight [ 2 ]. These\\\\ncapabilities have enabled a wide range of applications, ranging from travel planning [ 3 ], computer use [ 4, 5, 6 ],\\\\nto the multi-step research tasks [ 7 ]. To support such diverse and demanding tasks, a new class of systems called\\\\ngeneralist agents has emerged. These agents are designed to handle a wide range of domains and tasks through a unified\\\\narchitecture, allowing them to generalize beyond task-specific solutions, such as OpenAI Deep Research [ 1 ] and Manus.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, most of the current general-purpose agents heavily rely on large-scale manual engineering, including tediously\\\\ndesigned workflows, considerable pre-defined tools, and hardcoded components [ 8, 9 ]. This reliance introduces several\\\\ncritical limitations: i) It is impractical, if not impossible, to predefine all the tools required for the wide variety of\\\\nreal-world tasks an agent might encounter ( *imcomplete coverage* ); ii) Many complex tasks require agents to creatively\\\\ncompose new tools or leverage existing ones in novel ways while pre-designed workflow and hardcoded components\\\\nconstrain this compositional flexibility and inhibit the development of adaptive behaviors ( *limited creativity and*\\\\n*flexibility* ); iii) It is not always the case that the interface or environment of different tools are compatible with the agent\\\\n( *mismatch* ). For example, many useful tools are not written in Python, which makes it difficult, though not entirely\\\\nimpossible, for them to be pre-connected to the mainstream agent frameworks that are primarily written in Python.\\\\nTogether, these challenges ultimately hinder the scalability, adaptability, and generalization of existing generalist agents.\\\\n\\\\nIn contrast to the prevailing trend of growing complexity, we propose a radically simple design philosophy built on two\\\\nprinciples: i) *Minimal Predefinition* : Equip the agent with only a minimal set of core capabilities, avoiding manually\\\\nengineered components for specific tasks or modalities; ii) *Maximal Self-Evolution* : Empower the agent to autonomously\\\\ncreate, refine, and reuse external capabilities as needed. We instantiate this vision through Alita, a generalist agent built\\\\nwith a single core capability (i.e., the web agent) and a small set of general-purpose modules that enable self-directed\\\\ncapability expansion. Specifically, we take advantage of the Model Context Protocols (MCPs) [1] which is an open\\\\nprotocol that standardizes how different systems provide context to LLMs, and empower Alita to dynamically generate,\\\\nadapt, and reuse MCPs based on the demands of each task rather than relying on static, predefined tools. This shift from\\\\nmanually designed capabilities to on-the-fly MCP construction unlocks a new path for building agents that are simple\\\\nyet profoundly capable.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n|Col1|Col2|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n||MCP Creation|\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n|Col1|Col2|\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n|Self Evolving||\\\\n|||\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFigure 2: Comparison between Traditional Generalist Agents and Alita. Traditional generalist agents heavily rely on\\\\nlarge-scale manual engineering while Alita adheres to minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution.\\\\n\\\\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments on several benchmarks to assess Alita in real-world applications, especially\\\\non the most popular GAIA [ 10 ]. Alita proves that simplicity is not a constraint, but a strength, and that creative agent\\\\nbehavior can emerge from a design that prioritizes autonomy over manual engineering. To sum up, our key contributions\\\\ncan be summarized as follows.\\\\n\\\\n    - We propose a new agent architecture centered on minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution, challenging\\\\nconventional design norms in generalist agents, aiming to call for a more scalable and generalizable agent\\\\nframework.\\\\n\\\\n1 `https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol`\\\\n\\\\n2\\\\n\\\\n    - We present Alita, a generalist agent that achieves scalable agentic reasoning with a radically simple design.\\\\n\\\\n    - We empirically demonstrate that Alita, despite using no complex predefined tools and workflows for specific\\\\ntasks, outperforms many systems with significantly more handcrafted complexity on the GAIA benchmark.\\\\nWe achieve 75.15% pass@1 and 87.27% pass@3, surpassing OpenAI\\\\u2019s Deep Research with 67.36% pass@1\\\\nand ranking top among all general-purpose agents.\\\\n\\\\n**2** **Related Works**\\\\n\\\\n**2.1** **Generalist Agent**\\\\n\\\\nThe concept of a Generalist Agent aims to construct an AI agent system capable of collaboratively completing a variety\\\\nof complex tasks in a real-world environment. OWL [ 8 ] introduces a method that decomposes complex tasks into\\\\nsubtasks and dynamically allocates them to worker nodes with specialized toolkits. Omne [ 11 ] proposes a multiagent collaborative development framework, where each agent possesses an independent system structure, enabling\\\\nautonomous learning and the storage of a comprehensive world model to build an independent understanding of the\\\\nenvironment. OpenAI Deep Research [2] employs reinforcement learning for training on real-world tasks, aiming to\\\\nprovide precise and reliable research reports for knowledge-intensive tasks. A-World [ 12 ] offers a highly configurable,\\\\nmodular, and scalable simulation environment, allowing developers to flexibly define and integrate different types of AI\\\\nagents. The Magentic-One [ 13 ] framework merges the Magentic and Autogen systems, distinguishing between the\\\\nmicro-level LLM-driven function generation and the macro-level multi-agent orchestration, resulting in a clearer and\\\\nmore efficient construction of agent systems. Alita, also a Generalist Agent, allows for the minimal use of predefined\\\\ntools and workflows for direct problem-solving, yet still achieves impressive performance across diverse tasks.\\\\n\\\\n**2.2** **Auto Generating Agent**\\\\n\\\\nAuto-generating agents aim to enhance the versatility of agents by enabling them to autonomously generate tools,\\\\nagents, or workflows tailored to specific tasks. AutoAgents [ 14 ], for instance, generate multiple agents, each playing a\\\\ndistinct role, to handle the corresponding subtasks. OpenHands [ 15 ] offers an event-driven architecture that allows\\\\nagents to interact with the environment like human developers, thereby enabling the creation of custom workflows.\\\\nAFlow [ 16 ] redefines workflow optimization as a search problem, where each workflow consists of several nodes\\\\ninvoking large LLMs, and the optimal workflow is identified and executed through a search process. AutoAgent [ 17 ], as\\\\nan autonomous agent operating system, permits agents to manage system-level operations and file data autonomously.\\\\nIn Alita, agents are empowered to automatically generate diverse, specialized, and highly accurate MCPs to aid in the\\\\ncompletion of specific tasks, while also providing resources for future executions.\\\\n\\\\n**2.3** **Tool Creation**\\\\n\\\\nTool Creation enables agents to autonomously create tools to assist in task execution, either on their own or with external\\\\nsupport. CRAFT [ 18 ] utilizes GPT-4 to generate a set of code snippets that function as tools, which are then retrieved\\\\nand used in the system. TroVE [19] maintains a collection of high-level functions, which are automatically generated,\\\\nextended, and periodically pruned to optimize program generation. CREATOR [ 20 ] decouples the abstraction of tool\\\\ncreation from the actual execution, allowing LLMs to address tasks at different levels of granularity. AutoAgent [ 17 ]\\\\nenables agents to autonomously create new tools based on task requirements, incorporating information gathered\\\\nthrough web searches and integrating these tools into their workflow. OpenHands [ 15 ] allows agents to create code\\\\nscripts in a human-like manner during interaction with the environment to assist in task completion. In comparison,\\\\nAlita enables MCP creation, which provides additional benefits, including better reusability and easy environment\\\\nmanagement over tool creation.\\\\n\\\\n**2.4** **MCP**\\\\n\\\\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard proposed by Anthropic, designed to unify the connection between AI\\\\nsystems and external data sources and services. RAG-MCP [ 21 ] enhances the efficiency and accuracy of agents by\\\\nretrieving the most relevant tools from a large collection, based on the task description, within the database composed\\\\nof MCP descriptions. After tool generation, Alita wraps the generated valid tools into MCPs for subsequent use,\\\\nfacilitating reuse by itself and other agents.\\\\n\\\\n2 https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/\\\\n\\\\n3\\\\n\\\\n**3** **Methods**\\\\n\\\\nWe propose Alita, a generalist agent enabling scalable agentic reasoning with minimal predefinition and maximal\\\\nself-evolution to tackle diverse and complex tasks. Figure **3** illustrates the framework of Alita. In contrast to generalist\\\\nagents that typically depend on extensive manually-designed tools and workflows [ 8, 9 ], the manager agent in Alita\\\\nsolely orchestrates the web agent using only basic tools. Through this approach, our framework enables Alita to plan\\\\ntask-specific tools through brainstorming. It then utilizes a Web Agent to search for helpful open-source libraries\\\\nand other resources related to these tools. Leveraging the search results, Alita autonomously generates new tools and\\\\nconfigures the necessary environments to enhance its capabilities and effectively solve tasks. During this process, if\\\\nany issues arise with the newly generated tools or their environments, Alita can provide feedback and self-correct,\\\\nimproving the quality of the generated tools. Furthermore, the new tools can be encapsulated as MCP servers for future\\\\nreuse. With the aid of MCPs, Alita can generate increasingly powerful, diverse, and complex MCPs, thus establishing a\\\\nself-reinforcing cycle. Therefore, Alita autonomously expands its capabilities through continuous MCP integration.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFigure 3: The architecture of Alita. Upon receiving a question, the Manager Agent initiates an iterative CodeReAct\\\\nloop to analyze tasks, identify functional gaps, and trigger MCP Brainstorming for creative synthesis. The system\\\\ndynamically performs open-source searching, script generation, and virtual environment execution to construct taskrelated functions. Useful ones are encapsulated into reusable MCPs and stored in the MCP Box. Throughout this\\\\nprocess, the Manager Agent collaborates with the Web Agent for external information retrieval and continuously\\\\nintegrates intermediate results until a final output is produced. This process enables Alita to self-evolve without relying\\\\non a huge hand-crafted, elaborate tools and workflows.\\\\n\\\\n**3.1** **Execution Pipeline**\\\\n\\\\nEach task commences with the construction of an augmented prompt that incorporates the original query. The manager\\\\nagent (Sec. 3.2) then initiates a multi-step reasoning process to address the task at hand. Throughout this process, the\\\\nagent may query external sources via the web agent (Sec. 3.3), plan and synthesize new tools (Sec. 3.4), and execute\\\\nthem within isolated environments (Sec. 3.4.4).\\\\n\\\\nUpon successful tool generation and accurate result formulation, the corresponding script is transformed into an MCP\\\\nand stored in the internal tool registry for future reuse. All reasoning steps, intermediate code, and final outputs are\\\\nsystematically logged to facilitate comprehensive analysis.\\\\n\\\\n**3.2** **Manager Agent**\\\\n\\\\nThe Manager Agent functions as the central coordinator within framework of Alita. When receiving a task prompt, the\\\\nmanager agent initially calls the `MCP Brainstorming` to determine whether additional tools are needed and which\\\\nspecific tools are required. Then the manager agent decomposes the task into subtasks and dispatches them to web\\\\nagent or generates the required external tools to complete the subtask. When necessary, the manager agent utilizes the\\\\ninformation retrieved by the web agent to generate the required new tools along with their corresponding environment\\\\nconfiguration instructions. After collecting all intermediate results, the manager performs final aggregation and response\\\\nformulation.\\\\n\\\\n4\\\\n\\\\n**Tool Usage** . In contrast to traditional systems that rely on extensive predefined toolkits, the manager agent embraces Alita\\\\u2019s minimal philosophy by employing concise but powerful toolkits, including `MCP Brainstorming`,\\\\n`ScriptGeneratingTool` and `CodeRunningTool` . Specifically, `MCP Brainstorming` detects functional gaps, identifies necessary supplementary tools and outlines tool specifications; `ScriptGeneratingTool` obtains tool specification\\\\noutlines and then generates appropriate tools tailored to the task requirements; `CodeRunningTool` executes generated\\\\ncode in isolated environments and caches the output for potential MCP servers generation. These tools are intelligently\\\\ninvoked in response to the task\\\\u2019s evolving demands, ensuring adaptive and efficient problem-solving.\\\\n\\\\n**3.3** **Web Agent**\\\\n\\\\nThe web agent retrieves relevant information from external sources when internal knowledge is insufficient. It is\\\\nparticularly effective for tasks requiring the retrieval of domain-specific code or documentation. With a lightweight,\\\\ntext-based web interface and modular navigation tools, the web agent traverses multiple websites, extract relevant\\\\nsegments, and return reasonable URLs or raw content.\\\\n\\\\n**Tool Usage** . The agent utilizes `SimpleTextBrowser` as its web interface and page-level control tools: `VisitTool`,\\\\n`PageUpTool`, and `PageDownTool` to navigate webpages. For query-based lookups, it applies `GoogleSearchTool` for\\\\nopen web search and `GithubSearchTool` to identify reusable open-source tools. This design supports real-time code\\\\nretrieval and context-aware tool planning.\\\\n\\\\n**3.4** **MCP Creation Component**\\\\n\\\\nTo enable the creativity of the agent, we design three tools collaboratively contributing to the MCP creation process.\\\\n\\\\n**3.4.1** **MCP Brainstorming**\\\\n\\\\nSince LLMs often exhibit overconfidence in their capabilities [ 22 ], we introduce `MCP Brainstorming` to conduct\\\\npreliminary capability assessment by providing both the task and the description of current framework. We designed specialized prompts to facilitate accurate self-assessment of the agent\\\\u2019s capabilities. Moreover, when `MCP Brainstorming`\\\\nidentifies insufficient capabilities of the framework to complete the task, it provides references for tool generation to\\\\nbridge the capability gap. This provides prior guidance for subsequent tool selection and task planning required to\\\\naccomplish given objectives.\\\\n\\\\n**3.4.2** **ScriptGeneratingTool**\\\\n\\\\nThe `ScriptGeneratingTool` is a code-building utility designed for constructing external tools. It receives explicit\\\\nsubtask descriptions and suggestions for code construction from the manager agent, and potentially useful GitHub links\\\\nobtained via the web agent, which can provide information such as `README.md` files or code snippets from GitHub to\\\\nguide the script generation process. Furthermore, `ScriptGeneratingTool` generates the environment script to create\\\\nthe required environment for the code running and the cleaning script to clean up redundant files and environments\\\\ngenerated after script execution. Therefore, `ScriptGeneratingTool` ensures that the generated scripts are valid,\\\\nself-contained, and executable, making them suitable for deployment in the given task, and reusable in the future.\\\\n\\\\n**3.4.3** **CodeRunningTool**\\\\n\\\\nThe `CodeRunningTool` validates the functionality of the generated script by executing it within an isolated environment.\\\\nIf the execution produces the expected results, the tool is registered in the system as a reusable MCP. This process also\\\\nsupports iterative refinement, allowing for error inspection and subsequent code regeneration to improve the script\\\\u2019s\\\\nperformance.\\\\n\\\\n**3.4.4** **Environment Management**\\\\n\\\\nUpon retrieving or generating a candidate tool, the system activates the environment planner module. This module\\\\nparses the relevant repository or script metadata such as `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, and shell scripts using\\\\nthe `TextInspectorTool` . It extracts and validates the dependencies and setup instructions to construct an isolated\\\\nexecution profile. Subsequently, a new Conda environment is created with a unique name (typically derived from the\\\\ntask ID or a hash of the repository path), and dependencies are installed using `conda install` or `pip install` .\\\\n\\\\nAll runtime environments are initialized locally in parallel, obviating the need for administrative privileges or containerization technologies. This approach ensures high compatibility across various tasks while preserving the portability\\\\n\\\\n5\\\\n\\\\nof the system. During execution, the environment is explicitly activated prior to invoking the code interpreter, thus\\\\nensuring both isolation and reproducibility.\\\\n\\\\nIn the event of a failure during environment initialization\\\\u2014due to issues such as missing packages, syntax errors in setup\\\\nscripts, or unavailable dependencies\\\\u2014Alita activates an automated recovery procedure. This procedure attempts various\\\\nfallback strategies, including relaxing version constraints or identifying the minimal set of dependencies required for\\\\nfunctionality. If these recovery attempts are unsuccessful, the tool is discarded, and the failure is logged for offline\\\\nanalysis and future investigation. This enables Alita to self-correct its designed tools, thereby generating more accurate\\\\nand robust solutions.\\\\n\\\\n**4** **Experiments**\\\\n\\\\n**4.1** **Experiment Setting**\\\\n\\\\n**4.1.1** **Benchmarks**\\\\n\\\\nTo evaluate the general task-handling capabilities of Alita, we conducted extensive testing across multiple agent\\\\nbenchmarks.\\\\n\\\\n**GAIA [** **10** **]:** GAIA is a benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of general-purpose AI assistants.

Alita outperforms all\\\\nbaseline agents across the GAIA levels, achieving the highest total accuracy.\\\\n\\\\n**5** **Analysis**\\\\n\\\\n**5.1** **Reuse of Alita-Generated MCPs**\\\\n\\\\n**5.1.1** **Overview**\\\\n\\\\nWe collect the MCPs generated from running the GAIA dataset using Alita in conjunction with powerful models\\\\n(Claude-3.7-Sonnet and GPT-4o). The benefits of reusing Alita-generated MCPs are **two-fold** . First, these MCPs can be\\\\nreused by other agent frameworks and improve their performance since Alita, instead of human developers, designs a\\\\nset of useful MCPs fit to GAIA by trial and error. Second, these MCPs can be reused by agents with smaller LLMs\\\\nand **significantly** improve the performance. The reuse of auto-generated MCPs for agents with smaller LLMs can be\\\\nviewed as a new way of distillation from larger LLMs. Traditionally, distillation might be fine-tuning smaller LLMs on\\\\ndata generated by larger LLMs. In comparison, the reuse of MCPs generated from agents with larger LLMs is much\\\\neasier, cheaper, and faster than traditional distillation.\\\\n\\\\n7\\\\n\\\\n**5.1.2** **Reuse by Open Deep Research-smolagents**\\\\n\\\\nWe run open Deep Research-smolagents [ 25 ] on GAIA with and without Alita-generated MCPs based on GPT-4o. The\\\\nresults are presented in Table 2. From this experiment, we observe that the reuse of Alita-generated MCPs results in\\\\nbetter performance compared to the base framework for all difficulty levels. This demonstrates that Alita can generate\\\\nvery useful MCPs, which can be provided to other agents, helping them enhance their capabilities and solve problems\\\\nthat would otherwise be unsolvable. Additionally, the consistent improvement across all difficulty levels indicates that\\\\nAlita\\\\u2019s MCPs provide generalizable utility rather than just addressing specific edge cases in the dataset.\\\\n\\\\n**Model Configuration** **Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3** **Total**\\\\n\\\\nODR-smolagents + GPT-4o(No Alita MCPs) 33.96% 29.07% 11.54% 27.88%\\\\n\\\\nODR-smolagents + GPT-4o(With Alita MCPs) 39.62% 36.05% 15.38% **33.94%**\\\\n\\\\nTable 2: Comparison of performance between ODR-smolagents with and without Alita-generated MCPs. The results\\\\nare reported at different GAIA levels: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and the average. Each column corresponds to the\\\\nperformance at the respective GAIA levels. The reuse of Alita-generated MCPs can enhance the performance of other\\\\nagents.\\\\n\\\\n**5.1.3** **Reuse by Base Agent on Smaller LLM**\\\\n\\\\nWe reuse MCPs in the base framework, i.e., ODR-smolagents [ 25 ], without the MCP creation component in Alita, and\\\\nalso with some extra pre-defined tools used in ODR-smolagents based on GPT-4o-mini. The results are presented in\\\\nTable 3.\\\\n\\\\n**Model Configuration** **Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3** **Average**\\\\n\\\\nBase Framework + GPT-4o-mini (No Alita MCP) 32.08% 20.93% 3.85% 21.82%\\\\n\\\\nBase Framework + GPT-4o-mini (With Alita MCP) 39.62% 27.91% 11.54% **29.09%**\\\\n\\\\nTable 3: Comparison of performance between the base framework on GPT-4o-mini, with and without Alita-generated\\\\nMCPs. The results are reported at different GAIA levels: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and the average. Each column\\\\ncorresponds to the performance at the respective GAIA levels. The reuse of Alita-generated MCPs significantly\\\\nenhances the performance of agents on smaller LLMs.\\\\n\\\\nFrom this experiment, we observe that the reuse of Alita-generated MCPs significantly improves performance over the\\\\nbase framework based on a smaller LLM. This is because the Alita-generated MCPs can be considered MCPs distilled\\\\nfrom powerful models (Claude-3.7-Sonnet), which are made available for agents on smaller LLMs. This helps bridge\\\\nthe gap between the agents on smaller LLMs and agents on larger LLMs in certain domains, thereby enhancing its\\\\ntask-processing capabilities. Especially for Level 3, we observe a particularly dramatic improvement with the accuracy\\\\ntripling from **3.85** % to **11.54** %. This substantial improvement on the most challenging problems demonstrates that\\\\nAlita-generated MCPs are especially valuable for complex reasoning tasks where agents on smaller LLMs typically\\\\nstruggle the most. The MCPs effectively encapsulate sophisticated problem-solving capabilities that the smaller model\\\\ncan leverage without needing to develop the full reasoning chain independently.\\\\n\\\\n**5.2** **Alita on Smaller LLM**\\\\n\\\\nWe hypothesize that **Alita will be even stronger with the increasing coding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in**\\\\n**the future** . To validate our performance, we run Alita on GAIA using GPT-4o-mini instead of Claude-3.7-Sonnet. The\\\\nresults can be found in Table 4. Different to the experiment in Section 5.1.3, the agent doesn\\\\u2019t have distilled MCPs - the\\\\nagent on GPT-4o-mini model must generate its own MCPs. The results are presented in Table 4.\\\\n\\\\nFrom this experiment, on one hand, we observe that Alita, after replacing the models with GPT-4o-mini, performs\\\\nsignificantly worse on GAIA. This substantial performance gap highlights the critical role of the underlying models\\\\u2019\\\\ncoding capabilities. On the other hand, the performance of Alita increases rapidly as the capabilities of the underlying\\\\nmodels improve. We can expect that with future updates to the LLMs, Alita\\\\u2019s performance will continue to strengthen,\\\\nsurpassing its current capabilities. The design of future generalist agents might be much simpler in the future, without\\\\nany predefined tools and workflows for direct problem-solving. Instead, human developers might focus on designing\\\\nmodules for enabling and stimulating the creativity and evolution of generalist agents.\\\\n\\\\n8\\\\n\\\\n**Model Configuration** **Level 1** **Level 2** **Level 3** **Total**\\\\n\\\\nAlita (Claude-3.7-Sonnet, GPT-4o) 81.13% 75.58% 46.15% **72.73%**\\\\n\\\\nAlita (GPT-4o-mini) 54.72% 44.19% 19.23% 43.64%\\\\n\\\\nTable 4: Comparison of performance between Alita(Claude-3.7-Sonnet,GPT-4o) and Alita(GPT-4o-mini). The results\\\\nare reported at different GAIA levels: Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and the average. Each column corresponds to the\\\\nperformance at the respective GAIA levels. The integration of a smaller model significantly reduces the performance.\\\\n\\\\n**5.3** **Case Study**\\\\n\\\\nTo investigate Alita\\\\u2019s workflow when tackling tasks, we conducted a case study on its approach to solving a Level 3\\\\ndifficult problem in GAIA. The details of this process are presented in Appendix A. From the case study, we observe\\\\nthat Alita is able to perform a structured MCP brainstorming session based on the task at hand, effectively identifying\\\\nand utilizing relevant resources to implement a feasible MCP that aids in completing the task.\\\\n\\\\n**6** **Conclusion**\\\\n\\\\nIn this work, we introduced **Alita**, a generalist agent designed with the principles of minimal predefinition and maximal\\\\nself-evolution. By significantly reducing reliance on manually predefined tools and workflows for direct solving,\\\\nAlita leverages creative, autonomous capabilities in real time, facilitating scalable agentic reasoning. Our approach\\\\ndemonstrates that simplicity in design does not undermine, but rather enhances, the performance and adaptability of\\\\ngeneralist agents.\\\\n\\\\n9\\\\n\\\\n**References**\\\\n\\\\n[1] OpenAI.
