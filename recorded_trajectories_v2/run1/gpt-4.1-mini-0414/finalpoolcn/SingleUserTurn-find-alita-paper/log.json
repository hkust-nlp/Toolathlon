Notably, most interpretability\\npapers implement these maps as linear functions, motivated by the linear\\nrepresentation hypothesis: the idea that features are encoded linearly in a\\nmodel's representations. However, this linearity constraint is not required by\\nthe definition of causal abstraction. In this work, we critically examine the\\nconcept of causal abstraction by considering arbitrarily powerful alignment\\nmaps. In particular, we prove that under reasonable assumptions, any neural\\nnetwork can be mapped to any algorithm, rendering this unrestricted notion of\\ncausal abstraction trivial and uninformative. We complement these theoretical\\nfindings with empirical evidence, demonstrating that it is possible to\\nperfectly map models to algorithms even when these models are incapable of\\nsolving the actual task; e.g., on an experiment using randomly initialised\\nlanguage models, our alignment maps reach 100% interchange-intervention\\naccuracy on the indirect object identification task. This raises the non-linear\\nrepresentation dilemma: if we lift the linearity constraint imposed to\\nalignment maps in causal abstraction analyses, we are left with no principled\\nway to balance the inherent trade-off between these maps' complexity and\\naccuracy. Together, these results suggest an answer to our title's question:\\ncausal abstraction is not enough for mechanistic interpretability, as it\\nbecomes vacuous without assumptions about how models encode information.\\nStudying the connection between this information-encoding assumption and causal\\nabstraction should lead to exciting future work.\\nLinks: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08802v1||http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08802v1\\nPDF URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08802v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: NeuralOS: Towards Simulating Operating Systems via Neural Generative Models\\nSummary: We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user\\ninterfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in\\nresponse to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.\\nNeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer\\nstate, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images.

To validate its effectiveness, we apply cache steering to induce\\nchain-of-thought reasoning in small language models. Our approach leverages\\nGPT-4o-generated reasoning traces to construct steering vectors that shift\\nmodel behavior toward more explicit, multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning\\nor prompt modifications. Experimental evaluations on diverse reasoning\\nbenchmarks demonstrate that cache steering improves both the qualitative\\nstructure of model reasoning and quantitative task performance.

They are often preferred\\nover rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving\\nfree-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a\\ncandidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward\\nindicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task,\\nwe find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to\\nsuperficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., \\\":\\\" or \\\".\\\") or reasoning\\nopeners like \\\"Thought process:\\\" and \\\"Let's solve this problem step by step.\\\"\\ncan often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is\\nwidespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat\\nfor core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as\\nrejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue,\\nwe introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new\\ngenerative reward model with substantially improved robustness.

We do not assume that $A$ has an\\nidentity. The \\\\emph{multiplier algebra} $M(A)$ is a unital algebra associated\\nto $A$. If we require the product in $A$ to be non-degenerate (as a bilinear\\nform), the multiplier algebra can be characterized as the largest algebra\\ncontaining $A$ as an essential ideal. We recall the basic definitions and\\nprovide some more information about this notion.\\n  We endow the multiplier algebra $M(A)$ with the {\\\\it strict topology}. Then\\nwe show that $A$ is dense in $M(A)$ if and only if there exist local units in\\n$A$.\\n  We include various examples. In particular, we are interested in the\\nunderlying algebras of multiplier Hopf algebras, algebraic quantum groups,\\nalgebraic quantum hypergroups, weak multiplier Hopf algebras and algebraic\\nquantum groupoids. In all these cases, one can show that the algebras have\\nlocal units. We have also included some examples arising from co-Frobenius\\ncoalgebras.\\n  For most of the material treated in this note, it is only the ring structure\\nof the algebra that plays a role. For this reason, we develop the theory here\\nfor rings. But they are not required to have an identity for the multiplicative\\nstructure.\\nLinks: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08769v1||http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08769v1\\nPDF URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08769v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: Dually Hierarchical Drift Adaptation for Online Configuration Performance Learning\\nSummary: Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate\\nconfiguration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic\\nenvironments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates\\nwill inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts,\\nwhich reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and\\nlocal drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such,\\nexisting offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to\\nthese implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration\\nperformance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online\\nconfiguration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to\\nthese drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the\\nlocal and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper\\nlevel, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the\\nlocal model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the\\nlower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and\\nadapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA\\ncombines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize\\nredundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight\\nsoftware systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA\\nachieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with\\nup to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to\\nimprove different local models in handling concept drift.\\nLinks: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08730v1||http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08730v1\\nPDF URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08730v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: SPLASH! Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical demonstrations\\nSummary: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for\\nlearning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most\\napproaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which\\nis often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations\\nare not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable\\nrobot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting\\na critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic\\nagents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement\\nlearning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical\\ndemonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from\\nsuboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We\\nempirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation,\\nand demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation\\nexperiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed\\nmethods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward\\nlearning from suboptimal demonstrations.\\nLinks: http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08707v1||http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08707v1\\nPDF URL: http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08707v1\\n\\n\\nTitle: elsciRL: Integrating Language Solutions into Reinforcement Learning Problem Settings\\nSummary: We present elsciRL, an open-source Python library to facilitate the\\napplication of language solutions on reinforcement learning problems.
