However, many existing\\\\nframeworks depend heavily on manually predefined tools and workflows, which\\\\nhinder their adaptability, scalability, and generalization across domains. In\\\\nthis work, we introduce Alita--a generalist agent designed with the principle\\\\nof \\\\\\\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication,\\\\\\\" enabling scalable agentic\\\\nreasoning through minimal predefinition and maximal self-evolution. For minimal\\\\npredefinition, Alita is equipped with only one component for direct\\\\nproblem-solving, making it much simpler and neater than previous approaches\\\\nthat relied heavily on hand-crafted, elaborate tools and workflows. This clean\\\\ndesign enhances its potential to generalize to challenging questions, without\\\\nbeing limited by tools. For Maximal self-evolution, we enable the creativity of\\\\nAlita by providing a suite of general-purpose components to autonomously\\\\nconstruct, refine, and reuse external capabilities by generating task-related\\\\nmodel context protocols (MCPs) from open source, which contributes to scalable\\\\nagentic reasoning. Notably, Alita achieves 75.15% pass@1 and 87.27% pass@3\\\\naccuracy, which is top-ranking among general-purpose agents, on the GAIA\\\\nbenchmark validation dataset, 74.00% and 52.00% pass@1, respectively, on\\\\nMathvista and PathVQA, outperforming many agent systems with far greater\\\\ncomplexity.
