Now I have register three accounts
1. use login via google account
    username kewincpt93@gmail.com
    password kewincpt-9393

2. use login via google account
    username mcptest0606@gmail.com
    password MCPtest0606!!

3. directly login
    username mcptest0606@gmail.com
    password MCPtest0606!!
    *note: yes, I do not know why the email can be bonded to two different accounts, just because they are from two different login ways? But anyway it is OK to use them.

now the api key matches the account 1, which is the two student of `高级摸鱼理论` (teacher is 2) and `现代摸鱼理论` (teacher is 3)
