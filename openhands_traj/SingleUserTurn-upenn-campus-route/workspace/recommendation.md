### **1. ENIAC: The World's First General-Purpose Electronic Computer**

Penn is the birthplace of the modern computer, and the **ENIAC** (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) is the representative of this revolutionary invention. It was designed and built by Penn's John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert during World War II and was unveiled in 1946. This "giant brain" was initially intended to calculate ballistic trajectories for the U.S. Army. Its scale was immense, covering about 1,800 square feet, weighing 30 tons, and using 17,468 vacuum tubes, 70,000 resistors, and 10,000 capacitors. While the entire machine was later disassembled and moved elsewhere, the Penn School of Engineering still displays some original **ENIAC** panels to commemorate this extraordinary achievement. Visitors can get a glimpse into the dawn of the computer age through these exhibits and feel the weight of technological history.
