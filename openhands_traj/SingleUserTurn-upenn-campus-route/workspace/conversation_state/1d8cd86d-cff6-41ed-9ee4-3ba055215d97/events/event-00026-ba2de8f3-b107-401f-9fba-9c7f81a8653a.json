Let me organize the information:\\n\\nStarting point: Penn Bookstore (3601 Walnut St)\\nDestinations to visit:\\n1. ENIAC exhibits - School of Engineering (220 S 33rd St)\\n2. Penn Museum (3260 South St)\\n3. Benjamin Franklin Statue at College Hall (College Hall, Philadelphia)\\n4. Fisher Fine Arts Library (220 S 34th St)\\n5. College Hall (same location as Benjamin Franklin Statue)\\n\\nWait, I notice that Benjamin Franklin Statue and College Hall are essentially the same location since the statue is \\\"directly in front of College Hall\\\" according to the recommendation. However, the user specifically asked to list each attraction separately even if they are very close. So I should treat them as two separate stops at the same location.\\n\\nLet me analyze the distance matrix:\\n- From Bookstore to Engineering (ENIAC): 7 mins, 0.5 km\\n- From Bookstore to Penn Museum: 10 mins, 0.8 km  \\n- From Bookstore to College Hall: 4 mins, 0.3 km\\n- From Bookstore to Fisher Library: 5 mins, 0.4 km\\n\\n- From Engineering to Penn Museum: 5 mins, 0.3 km\\n- From Engineering to College Hall: 5 mins, 0.3 km\\n- From Engineering to Fisher Library: 2 mins, 0.1 km\\n\\n- From Penn Museum to College Hall: 8 mins, 0.5 km\\n- From Penn Museum to Fisher Library: 6 mins, 0.4 km\\n\\n- From College Hall to Fisher Library: 2 mins, 0.2 km\\n\\nNow I need to find the shortest route that visits all locations. This is essentially a Traveling Salesman Problem. Let me consider different routes:\\n\\nOption 1: Bookstore \u2192 College Hall \u2192 Fisher Library \u2192 Engineering \u2192 Penn Museum\\n- Bookstore to College Hall: 4 mins, 0.3 km\\n- College Hall to Fisher Library: 2 mins, 0.2 km  \\n- Fisher Library to Engineering: 2 mins, 0.1 km\\n- Engineering to Penn Museum: 5 mins, 0.3 km\\nTotal: 13 mins, 0.9 km\\n\\nOption 2: Bookstore \u2192 Fisher Library \u2192 Engineering \u2192 College Hall \u2192 Penn Museum\\n- Bookstore to Fisher Library: 5 mins, 0.4 km\\n- Fisher Library to Engineering: 2 mins, 0.1 km\\n- Engineering to College Hall: 5 mins, 0.3 km\\n- College Hall to Penn Museum: 8 mins, 0.5 km\\nTotal: 20 mins, 1.3 km\\n\\nOption 3: Bookstore \u2192 College Hall \u2192 Fisher Library \u2192 Engineering \u2192 Penn Museum\\nSame as Option 1: 13 mins, 0.9 km\\n\\nOption 4: Bookstore \u2192 Engineering \u2192 Fisher Library \u2192 College Hall \u2192 Penn Museum\\n- Bookstore to Engineering: 7 mins, 0.5 km\\n- Engineering to Fisher Library: 2 mins, 0.1 km\\n- Fisher Library to College Hall: 2 mins, 0.2 km\\n- College Hall to Penn Museum: 8 mins, 0.5 km\\nTotal: 19 mins, 1.3 km\\n\\nThe shortest route appears to be Option 1: Bookstore \u2192 College Hall (Benjamin Franklin Statue) \u2192 Fisher Fine Arts Library \u2192 Engineering (ENIAC) \u2192 Penn Museum\\n\\nSince Benjamin Franklin Statue and College Hall are at the same location, I'll treat visiting both as happening at the same stop but list them separately in the route plan as requested.\"} for tool 'think': 1 validation error for ThinkAction\nkind\n  Input should be 'ThinkAction' [type=literal_error, input_value='planning', input_type=str]\n    For further information visit https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.11/v/literal_error"}
